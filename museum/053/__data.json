There are some grounds for thinking that the main bronze plate of B has been re-used. Firstly, the area of the inscribed field is visibly recessed compared to the surface of the remainder of the main plate (visible at both the top and bottom of the inscribed field), which would suggest that the original surface was removed in preparation for the inscribing of this text. Secondly, immediately above the top of the inscribed field (and outside the recessed area), but mostly obscured by the entabulature, it is possible to make out a number of engraved strokes. These may be traces of a wreath, similar to that in the upper part of the present inscription, but belonging to a preceding, now-erased, text.",{"_":2273,"ana":2274,"ref":2275},{"ana":44},{"lettering":2332,"dimensions":2333},"The letters of line 1 are largest (c. 7-11 mm high); those of lines 2-7 smaller (3-7 mm), and those of lines 8-32 smaller again (generally 3-5 mm). In l. 1, epsilon and sigma are quadrate (Ε, Σ), but omega is lunate (Ω) – contrast A with closed omega; in ll. 2-32 all three letters are lunate (ϵ, ϲ, ω), as in A. There are a number of minor variations in letter-form compared with A: delta shows a marked tendency to include an apex, which is found irregularly also in alpha and lamda; eta almost always takes the standard form in B (in contrast to the ‘reversed nu’ form in A); the xsi is similar; the tendency in A for pi to show curvature in the tail of one or both of the vertical hastas is not generally visible in B; broken-bar alpha is wholly absent from B (with the possible exception of line 4); the occasional equivalence between tau and upsilon in A is not found in B. B is inscribed by means of chasing with a chisel, like A. Terminal points at the end of strokes are however much less pronounced, or absent, which finds its counterpoint in the presence of apices or serifs on some of the letters made up of long strokes: as in stone inscriptions, serifs in part serve a functional purpose in assisting in the termination of the chisel stroke and its extraction from the surface. At the same time, the letters of B are generally thinner and so slightly more lightly chased (in so far as this is not simply a consequence of partial loss of the surface following damage in the fire and cleaning). In other words, there are grounds for thinking that, although the tools are the same, the technique and stylistic choices of the individual at work are subtly different from that in A, and hence that a different engraver was at work here.
