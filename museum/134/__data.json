Maps and information boards provide context for well chosen pieces from the surrounding region. The first few rooms are organised chronologically and by site, with an occasional focus on particular object categories (e.g. Obsidian). They begin with the Neolithic and proceed through the Bronze age and Archaic periods before the main room (which concentrates on ancient Phintias) which looks at the acropolis, urban topography and domestic quarters. A room underneath the main room displays the famous golden jewellery and coins found in Phintias",{"settlement":8,"region":9,"country":10,"address":11,"geo":12},"Licata","Agrigento","Italy","Via Dante 12 92027 - Licata (AG) Cistercian Abbey",{"lat":13,"lon":14},37.10065,13.93959,[16,103],{"file":17,"uri":17,"title":18,"status":19,"editionAuthor":21,"type":22,"objectType":26,"material":30,"condition":34,"layoutDesc":35,"handNote":42,"date":55,"places":61,"geo":69,"country":10,"region":73,"settlement":8,"repository":74,"idno":75,"textLang":77,"facsimile":81,"provenance":63,"letterHeights":88,"publications":89,"keywords":92},"ISic003345","Fragmentary list of names",{"_":20},"draft",null,{"_":23,"ana":24,"ref":25},"list","#function.list","http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/typeins/lod/108.html",{"_":27,"ana":28,"ref":29},"plaque","#object.plaque","http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/objtyp/lod/259",{"_":31,"ana":32,"ref":33},"limestone\n                                    ","#material.stone.limestone","http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/material/lod/66.html","",{"layout":36},{"p":37,"rs":38,"damage":34},"13 lines of Greek letters, with a regular left margin, set out in pseudo-stoichedon, and a vacat at the end",{"_":39,"ana":40,"ref":41},"chiselled","#execution.chiselled","http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/writing/lod/1",{"lettering":43,"dimensions":44},"regular quadrate letters of the Hellenistic period, well spaced.
