The upper face of the cowl (concave) is 940 mm\n                                        long, wider at the top, narrowing towards the head (88 mm wide at the start of\n                                        the text, 47 mm wide at the end of the text). As with #4, on the upper part of\n                                        the face is a moulded relief of a winged victory, carrying a laurel crown in\n                                        right hand and palm frond in left. In contrast to #4, there is a small amount of\n                                        blank space above and below the winged victory. As with the Egadi 4 ram, the\n                                        inscription is moulded and cast, constituting part of the original casting of\n                                        the ram along with the relief decoration. The letters are in strong relief (3-4\n                                        mm high). The text occupies a length of 483 mm; line 1 is shorter, with a vacat\n                                        following, but the final two letters of line 2 are significantly larger than\n                                        those preceding and fill most of the available field. Blank space follows the\n                                        text. The surface is in very good condition, and after cleaning the text is\n                                        clear and the letters sharp.",{"lettering":43,"dimensions":44},"The letters of line 1 are between 25 and 36 mm in height, largest at the beginning,\n                                    and reducing significantly in size after the first six letters: the first six\n                                    letters are 31-36 mm; the last five letters are 25-27 mm in height. In line 2, the\n                                    initial M is 38 mm high, the remainder, excluding the final two, are between 33 and\n                                    25 mm, reducing steadily in height as the line proceeds. The second O is incomplete,\n                                    as its base projected over the edge of the cowl face and was cut off in the making\n                                    of the mould. The final two letters (Q and P) are 36 and 33 mm in height and sit\n                                    higher in the field. They are not therefore the largest letters in the inscription,\n                                    although they may appear so to the naked eye as a result of the text layout.\n                                    Interpuncts are formed by circular dots (also in relief) and are placed between\n                                    every word, but not at line end. Letter forms: M is formed by sloping hastae, with\n                                    the middle point touching the baseline; P is rectilinear and open, with the right\n                                    vertical slightly less than half the length of the left; O fills the full letter\n                                    height; L is sharply hooked; F has equal horizontal bars; Q has a near horizontal\n                                    tail coming off bottom right; A has broken bar; E has a slightly shorter middle bar;\n                                    R has a closed and rounded head, the tail does not extend to the baseline.",[45,51],{"type":46,"l":47,"from":48,"to":48,"h":49,"unit":50},"letterHeight","Line 1","line1","25-36","mm",{"type":46,"l":52,"from":53,"to":53,"h":54,"unit":50},"Line 2","line2","25-38",{"_":56,"notBefore":57,"notAfter":58},"First Punic War, no later\n                                than 241 BCE",-264,-241,[60,64],{"_":61,"type":62,"ref":63},"Aegusa","ancient","http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/462084",{"_":8,"type":65,"ref":66},"modern","http://sws.geonames.org/2524779",[68],[69,70],37.9310758,12.3286129,"Sicily",{"_":4,"role":3,"ref":5},{"_":74,"type":75},"Egadi 6 ('Cece')","inventory",{"_":77,"mainLang":78,"languages":79},"Latin","la",[77],{"n":81,"url":82,"height":83,"width":84,"desc":85,"surfaceType":86},"screen","ISic004367_tiled.tif","6666px","5000px","Photo S.
