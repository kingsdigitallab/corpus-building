The first room looks at sites from around the area (Terravecchia and Monte Riparato). The second room has later material from the site of Caltavuturo vecchio. The third room is dedicated to Monte Riparato (small finds, mosaic, Greek inscription) some 7th century BC, but mainly 4th and 3rd, and some Samian ware. The final room is given over to the numismatic collection, the focal point of which is a Republican coin hoard found in the area",{"settlement":8,"region":9,"country":10,"address":11,"geo":12},"Caltavuturo","Palermo","Italy","Museo Civico \"Don G.
