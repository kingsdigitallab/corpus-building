Theta is formed by large circle with single mid-dot; epsilon on occasion has a shorter middle bar; omega is notable in being consistently extremely open, with short horizontal tails (projecting outwards only); omicron is generally full-size, or nearly so, but also smaller; kappa has equal length arms which join the vertical, but do not generally extend fully to the top/bottom of the line; alpha is broad with straight bar; phi has a rounded closed eye; nu on occasion has a shorter right vertical, leaning outwards; sigma is either four straight bars (with top and bottom strokes open beyond the horizontal) or with the top and bottom strokes joined by a single curving stroke; rho is closed, with either a rounded or an angular eye; pi has a shorter right hasta; mu is in one case
