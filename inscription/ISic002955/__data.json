Small domestic altars of this sort are common, with the name of the divinity to which it is dedicated often in the genitive. The combination of Zeus Soter (Zeus the Saviour, a common form of Zeus; pot sherd graffiti on display in the same gallery as this altar in the Siracusa Archaeological museum attest to the existence of Zeus Soter cult in Hellenistic Syracuse; also possibly attested at Megara Hyblaea ()) together with the name Hieron encourages the idea that this altar reflects the existence of a ruler cult for Hieron II of Syracuse, with Hieron assimilated to Zeus Soter. The form of the letters is compatible with a third-century date. However, the presence of all three words in the genitive in this way is not typical and is awkward grammatically and lacks easy parallels. Additionally, there is no evidence for official ruler cult for Hieron II of Syracuse (see the extensive discussion in  and  in particular). The nature of the object (small domestic altar) together with the rather crude form of the inscription both suggest a private domestic context; however, the existence of such private veneration would more commonly be assumed on the basis of public cult.",[475,477,479],{"_":476,"target":192},"Treziny 2018: 221",{"_":478,"target":158},"Habicht 1970",{"_":480,"target":184},"Serrati 2008",{"type":482,"listBibl":483},"bibliography",[484,523],{"type":107,"bibl":485},[486,489,492,495,498,501,504,507,510,511,514,517,520],{"type":110,"n":111,"citedRange":112,"ptr":487,"ref":488},{"target":114},{"_":116,"target":116},{"type":110,"n":111,"citedRange":118,"ptr":490,"ref":491},{"target":114},{"_":116,"target":116},{"type":110,"n":111,"citedRange":122,"ptr":493,"ref":494},{"target":114},{"_":116,"target":116},{"type":110,"n":126,"citedRange":127,"ptr":496,"ref":497},{"target":129},{"_":131,"target":131},{"type":110,"n":126,"citedRange":133,"ptr":499,"ref":500},{"target":129},{"_":131,"target":131},{"type":110,"n":137,"author":138,"title":137,"date":139,"citedRange":140,"ptr":502,"ref":503},{"target":142},{"_":144,"target":144},{"author":146,"date":147,"citedRange":148,"ptr":505,"ref":506},{"target":150},{"_":152,"target":152},{"author":154,"date":155,"citedRange":156,"ptr":508,"ref":509},{"target":158},{"_":160,"target":160},{"author":146,"date":162,"citedRange":163},{"author":165,"date":166,"citedRange":167,"ptr":512,"ref":513},{"target":169},{"_":171,"target":171},{"author":173,"date":174,"citedRange":175,"ptr":515,"ref":516},{"target":177},{"_":179,"target":179},{"author":181,"date":182,"ptr":518,"ref":519},{"target":184},{"_":186,"target":186},{"author":188,"date":189,"citedRange":190,"ptr":521,"ref":522},{"target":192},{"_":194,"target":194},{"type":196,"bibl":31},[525,526],{"n":427,"url":92,"height":428,"width":429,"desc":93,"surfaceType":424},{"n":427,"url":434,"height":435,"width":436,"desc":93,"surfaceType":424},{"title":528,"body":529,"divs":530,"images":544},"ISic002955.
