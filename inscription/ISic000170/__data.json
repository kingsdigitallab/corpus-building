Mommsen rightly also notes that Gualtherus offers no indication that the stone was damaged or missing letters at the ends of either lines 2 or 4; it is however clear that at least the letter N followed in line 2 (traces are visible); whether the numeral was only X, or larger, cannot be known, nor whether 'datus' was written as 'd(atus)', or 'dat(us)' or as 'datus'. It appears that the stone has gone unrecorded between Gualtherus' report and our own identification of the surviving upper fragment in the museum in 2023. Bivona (1994) suggests that given his name, and that the land for the tomb was assigned to his parents, Cn. Domitius Piso must have been a notable figure in Thermae Himeraeae. There are numerous literary and epigraphic attestations to the gens Domitia across Sicily from a broad period (Republican-4th century CE). Notable, particularly, is a Domitius Himeraeus from Thermae Himeraeae ().",{"_":590,"target":591},"ISic000169","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000169",{"type":593,"listBibl":594},"bibliography",[595,617],{"type":114,"bibl":596},[597,600,603,606,609,614,32],{"author":117,"date":93,"citedRange":118,"ptr":598,"ref":599},{"target":120},{"_":122,"target":122},{"author":117,"date":124,"citedRange":125,"ptr":601,"ref":602},{"target":127},{"_":129,"target":129},{"author":131,"date":132,"citedRange":133,"ptr":604,"ref":605},{"target":135},{"_":137,"target":137},{"author":131,"date":139,"citedRange":140,"ptr":607,"ref":608},{"target":142},{"_":144,"target":144},{"type":146,"n":147,"citedRange":610,"ptr":612,"ref":613},{"ref":611},{"_":150,"target":151},{"target":153},{"_":155,"target":155},{"type":146,"n":157,"citedRange":158,"ptr":615,"ref":616},{"target":160},{"_":162,"target":162},{"type":164,"bibl":32},[619,620],{"n":413,"url":102,"height":414,"width":415,"desc":103,"surfaceType":410},{"n":413,"url":423,"height":414,"width":415,"desc":103,"surfaceType":420},{"title":622,"body":623,"divs":624,"images":638},"ISic000170.
