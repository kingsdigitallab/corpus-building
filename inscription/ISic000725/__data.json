It is impossible to know if the piece should be associated with any of the various elements reported by Gentili in the vicinity (including marble architectural elements, a nymphaeum (size and form unclear), a third-century domus, and traces of earlier rooms or structures also. The exact form/purpose of the surviving block is also unclear, since the surviving stone, only partially preserved, appears to be potentially part of a larger structure originally, rather than a free-standing base.","There is some dispute over the reading of line 3, with Gentili, followed by Manganaro reading a V at the end of the line. There is the possible trace of the deepest point of a stroke termination or serif right on the break, which could be the upper left of the next letter, but this could belong to multiple letters and cannot be diagnostic. The fine upward left curving line that is just visible on the surface of the stone to the right of the M may be what induced Gentili to read a V (part of it is marked in his drawing), but this is clearly no more than a superficial flaw in the surface and categorically not a letter trace. The same applies to the supposed trace of a crossbar in the right half of the M, which lead Mayer to suggest that A should be read in ligature with the M. Whether the M is the initial letter of a cognomen, or is the abbreviated praenomen of Sextia's patronymic, cannot be resolved (I take Eck's printing of M.f.[---] to be an error, rather than an assertion that the F can be read on the stone).","Manganaro (1988: 86 n.485) proposed to read C. Roscius [f. -(cognomen)] / procos. [prov. Siciliae]/ Sextia Mu[cia(?) - nymphaeum (?)] / fecerun[t --]. Eck (1996) offered strong arguments against such a reading, noting the lack of parallels for (a) a proconsul giving his full title while governor and (b) for a proconsul in office undertaking work jointly in his official capacity with either his wife of a private citizen (depending on the identification of Sextia). Eck very plausibly argues that Roscius should be assumed to be a local senator (the rest of Eck 1996 discusses the eastern Sicilian Roscii among other families in some detail), erecting something in his home city, probably alongside his wife, with the essentials of his career detailed in descending order in line 2  (at p.125 he suggests the likely restoration: C. Roscius [- f. (tribus/cognomen)] / procos., [pr., aed., q.?] / Sextia M.f. [(cognomen or building or 'a solo')] / fecerun[t et dedicaverunt?]).
