Furthermore, these parallels serve to confirm the reading of lines 2 and 3 of the text in the Adrano museum. The language of the stone is far from certain, given the use of K which would be normal for Greek, but the appearance of L which is in the Latin form. Mixed use of letters and language in Sicily is relatively common, and it therefore remains possible that an interpretation of line 1 in the Adrano text understanding that line at least as Greek, and so involving an abbreviation for Τέρμων, as proposed by Manganaro should be considered.","The date of the stone is very difficult to ascertain. The letters by themselves would allow for a date from the Hellenistic period onwards. If the interpretation suggested by Ferrua is adopted, making this one of several boundary markers for church property from the wider area of the Catania hinterland, then a date of the fifth century AD or later seems likely. It would be possible to accept the reading of KAT as refering to Catania, without accepting the need to interpret ECL or EKL as a reference to the church.",{"type":474,"listBibl":475},"bibliography",[476,582],{"type":402,"bibl":477},[478,489,497,504,512,520,527,538,549,559,567,574],{"type":479,"n":480,"citedRange":481,"ptr":485,"ref":487},"corpus","IG",{"ref":482},{"_":483,"target":484},"14.0585","https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760",{"target":486},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/Q2SBPG9F",{"_":488,"target":488},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072",{"type":490,"n":491,"citedRange":492,"ptr":493,"ref":495},"bulletin","SEG","45.1353",{"target":494},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/F2GG87EQ",{"_":496,"target":496},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796",{"type":479,"n":498,"citedRange":499,"ptr":500,"ref":502},"CIG","3.5742b",{"target":501},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/HTUDQBXS",{"_":503,"target":503},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252",{"author":505,"date":506,"citedRange":507,"ptr":508,"ref":510},"Manganaro","1994","171-174 tav.7",{"target":509},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/ZHFSM94Z",{"_":511,"target":511},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823",{"author":513,"date":514,"citedRange":515,"ptr":516,"ref":518},"Biondi","2002","74 with n.117",{"target":517},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/CFHKJPUN",{"_":519,"target":519},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002588",{"author":513,"date":521,"citedRange":522,"ptr":523,"ref":525},"2010","88",{"target":524},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/GSAMDGK4",{"_":526,"target":526},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002150",{"author":528,"date":529,"citedRange":530,"ptr":534,"ref":536},"Gualtherus","1624 [1625]",{"ref":531},{"_":532,"target":533},"50 no. 332","http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/310975",{"target":535},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/ZP8DE8KS",{"_":537,"target":537},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931",{"author":539,"date":540,"citedRange":541,"ptr":545,"ref":547},"Castelli","1769",{"ref":542},{"_":543,"target":544},"72 cl. 7 no. 25","http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/501368",{"target":546},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/SPTB56H3",{"_":548,"target":548},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084",{"author":539,"date":550,"citedRange":551,"ptr":555,"ref":557},"1784",{"ref":552},{"_":553,"target":554},"77 cl. 7 no. 26","http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/501780",{"target":556},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/7PSFHSUH",{"_":558,"target":558},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083",{"author":560,"date":561,"citedRange":562,"ptr":563,"ref":565},"Russo","1911","59",{"target":564},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/CRSSWMDV",{"_":566,"target":566},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001615",{"author":505,"date":568,"citedRange":569,"ptr":570,"ref":572},"1980","434 with n.112",{"target":571},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/VQBJ735Q",{"_":573,"target":573},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001836",{"author":575,"date":576,"citedRange":577,"ptr":578,"ref":580},"Prag","2015","327-330 no. 3",{"target":579},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/SHKXSQLC",{"_":581,"target":581},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002338",{"type":583,"bibl":52},"discussion",[585,586,587,588,589],{"n":370,"url":107,"height":371,"width":372,"desc":108,"surfaceType":367},{"n":370,"url":377,"height":371,"width":372,"desc":108,"surfaceType":367},{"n":370,"url":384,"height":371,"width":372,"desc":108,"surfaceType":381},{"n":370,"url":391,"height":372,"width":371,"desc":108,"surfaceType":388},{"n":370,"url":395,"height":372,"width":371,"desc":108,"surfaceType":388},{"title":591,"body":592,"divs":593,"images":607},"ISic001404.

The language of the stone is far from certain, given the use of K which would be normal for Greek, but the appearance of L which is in the Latin form.

Furthermore, these parallels serve to confirm the reading of lines 2 and 3 of the text in the Adrano museum. The language of the stone is far from certain, given the use of K which would be normal for Greek, but the appearance of L which is in the Latin form. Mixed use of letters and language in Sicily is relatively common, and it therefore remains possible that an interpretation of line 1 in the Adrano text understanding that line at least as Greek, and so involving an abbreviation for Τέρμων, as proposed by Manganaro should be considered.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The date of the stone is very difficult to ascertain. The letters by themselves would allow for a date from the Hellenistic period onwards. If the interpretation suggested by Ferrua is adopted, making this one of several boundary markers for church property from the wider area of the Catania hinterland, then a date of the fifth century AD or later seems likely. It would be possible to accept the reading of KAT as refering to Catania, without accepting the need to interpret ECL or EKL as a reference to the church.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":474,"html":603},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0585\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 45.1353 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 3.5742b \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1994 171-174 tav.7 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Biondi 2002 74 with n.117 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002588\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002588\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Biondi 2010 88 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002150\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002150\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 [1625] \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/310975\" target=\"_blank\">50 no. 332\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1769 \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/501368\" target=\"_blank\">72 cl. 7 no. 25\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1784 \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/501780\" target=\"_blank\">77 cl. 7 no. 26\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Russo 1911 59 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001615\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001615\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1980 434 with n.112 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001836\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001836\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag 2015 327-330 no. 3 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002338\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002338\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":605,"html":606},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
