The nomen in line 2 could well be [Vett]ius (there is a possible trace of the cross-bar of the T): the formulation is a little unusual, with no indication of the relationship between Faustus and Optatus, with the most likely resolution being that they are members of the same family.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/books/CILv10pII1883\" target=\"_blank\">10.7405\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 98 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[509,511,513,515,517,519],{"id":116,"html":510},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>.?]ETTIOFAUS\u003Cspan class=\"tall\" title=\"tall character: t\">T\u003C/span>O\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>].USOPTATUS\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>[.]IBIETSU\u003Cspan class=\"tall\" title=\"tall character: i\">I\u003C/span>S\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":475,"html":512},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text based on autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"2\">2: \u003Cspan>There is the possible trace of a horizontal bar at the start of the line, compatible with E or T.\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":483,"html":514},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>[---] to [?]ettius Faustus, [---]ius Optatus (set this up) for himself and his family.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":486,"html":516},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>As noted by Bivona (1994), the most obvious restoration of 'ettio' in line 1 is Vettius, as the gens Vettia is known to exist in Sicily in the Ciceronian period.
