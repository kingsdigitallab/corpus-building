However, this is undoubtedly the same text as is reported by Giuseppe Alessi in 1833 as having been found (and preserved) by him on the southern slopes of the town at an unrecorded moment prior to 1833. Alessi describes it as 'in pietra arenaria', which aligns well with this 'pietra calcarea di colore arancio' as Korhonen describes it. More significantly, however, Alessi's record of the text is surely the same: his transcription of line 1 is entirely compatible with the state of the text on the stone (the damage to the kappa undoubtedly corresponds to the stop in his text; and the remaining strokes of the lamda and eta very obviously correspond to his 'M'); in line 2 it is no less apparent that the second vertical of the eta has been conflated with the left side of the sigma in his reading, producing the ΙΣ (lunate) of his text. Further supporting confirmation can be offered by the fact that a second text of those reported by Alessi in the same publication () has ended up in the collection of the Museo Civico di Catania (that text passed from Alessi's collection to the University and thence to the civic collection - see Korhonen ad loc.)",{"_":472,"target":473},"ISic001375","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001375",{"_":475,"ref":476},"The usual form of the vocative would be Φιλοκλεῖς, but parallels can be found for the form in this inscription, such as in a second-century BC example from Delos, in M.T.
