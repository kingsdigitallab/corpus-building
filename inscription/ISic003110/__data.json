The name Philokles is a common one, found elsewhere in Sicily (e.g. at Akrai and Monte San Fratello = ancient Apollonia (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001187\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001187\u003C/a>)).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The provenance of the text was unknown when edited by Korhonen in 2004, and there appears to be no record of how it entered the civic collection; as Korhonen rightly notes, the material of the stone lacks parallels with other texts from Catania.

Alessi describes it as 'in pietra arenaria', which aligns well with this 'pietra calcarea di colore arancio' as Korhonen describes it. More significantly, however, Alessi's record of the text is surely the same: his transcription of line 1 is entirely compatible with the state of the text on the stone (the damage to the kappa undoubtedly corresponds to the stop in his text; and the remaining strokes of the lamda and eta very obviously correspond to his 'M'); in line 2 it is no less apparent that the second vertical of the eta has been conflated with the left side of the sigma in his reading, producing the ΙΣ (lunate) of his text.
