Manganaro plausibly proposes Serapis as the other deity, followed (for example) by Sfameni Gasparro; Manganaro suggests the form Σαράπει as being the older, to align with the form Ἴσει. In a more ambitious conjectural restoration of the whole, Manganaro (1961: 177 n.9) suggested that the dedication was made by the Syracusans for an individual and his wife: [Ὁ δᾶμος τῶν Συρακοσίων] | [ὑπέρ ... ἀρε]τῆς (vac.) [καἰ δικαιοσ]ύ[νης] | (τὸν δεῖνα τοῦ δεῖνος) καὶ? Πυθιάδα τὰν αὑτ[οῦ γ]υναῖκα | [Σαράπει (vac.) ] καὶ (vac.) Ἴσει. However, this seems to be incompatible with both the apparent trace of an epsilon near the end of line 1, and, more significantly, the vacats after both sigma and upsilon in line 2 (the end of line two can contain at most a three letter word after a word ending in upsilon, assuming that the right side of the stone is only lightly damaged). Assuming the restoration of the name of Serapis in line 4, then either the block itself was essentially the same width again on the left, or a second block joined to the left. It seems likely that only a very small amount is lost from the right side. One could, for instance, alternatively imagine the name of the husband in the nominative in line 2 (---της --[ο]υ) i.e. idionym ending in -της and patronym, but this does not resolve the restoration of line 1 or the first part of lines 2 or 3. It remains likely that -άδα is the accusative ending of the woman's name (alternatives such as παστάδα, and so the dedication of a building, seem implausible given the rest of the line).

Manganaro plausibly proposes Serapis as the other deity, followed (for example) by Sfameni Gasparro; Manganaro suggests the form Σαράπει as being the older, to align with the form Ἴσει. In a more ambitious conjectural restoration of the whole, Manganaro (1961: 177 n.9) suggested that the dedication was made by the Syracusans for an individual and his wife: [Ὁ δᾶμος τῶν Συρακοσίων] | [ὑπέρ ... ἀρε]τῆς (vac.)

Assuming the restoration of the name of Serapis in line 4, then either the block itself was essentially the same width again on the left, or a second block joined to the left. It seems likely that only a very small amount is lost from the right side.
