Manganaro plausibly proposes Serapis as the other deity, followed (for example) by Sfameni Gasparro; Manganaro suggests the form Σαράπει as being the older, to align with the form Ἴσει. In a more ambitious conjectural restoration of the whole, Manganaro (1961: 177 n.9) suggested that the dedication was made by the Syracusans for an individual and his wife: [Ὁ δᾶμος τῶν Συρακοσίων] | [ὑπέρ ... ἀρε]τῆς (vac.) [καἰ δικαιοσ]ύ[νης] | (τὸν δεῖνα τοῦ δεῖνος) καὶ? Πυθιάδα τὰν αὑτ[οῦ γ]υναῖκα | [Σαράπει (vac.) ] καὶ (vac.) Ἴσει. However, this seems to be incompatible with both the apparent trace of an epsilon near the end of line 1, and, more significantly, the vacats after both sigma and upsilon in line 2 (the end of line two can contain at most a three letter word after a word ending in upsilon, assuming that the right side of the stone is only lightly damaged). Assuming the restoration of the name of Serapis in line 4, then either the block itself was essentially the same width again on the left, or a second block joined to the left. It seems likely that only a very small amount is lost from the right side. One could, for instance, alternatively imagine the name of the husband in the nominative in line 2 (---της --[ο]υ) i.e. idionym ending in -της and patronym, but this does not resolve the restoration of line 1 or the first part of lines 2 or 3. It remains likely that -άδα is the accusative ending of the woman's name (alternatives such as παστάδα, and so the dedication of a building, seem implausible given the rest of the line).

Manganaro plausibly proposes Serapis as the other deity, followed (for example) by Sfameni Gasparro; Manganaro suggests the form Σαράπει as being the older, to align with the form Ἴσει. In a more ambitious conjectural restoration of the whole, Manganaro (1961: 177 n.9) suggested that the dedication was made by the Syracusans for an individual and his wife: [Ὁ δᾶμος τῶν Συρακοσίων] | [ὑπέρ ... ἀρε]τῆς (vac.) [καἰ δικαιοσ]ύ[νης] | (τὸν δεῖνα τοῦ δεῖνος) καὶ? Πυθιάδα τὰν αὑτ[οῦ γ]υναῖκα | [Σαράπει (vac.) ] καὶ (vac.) Ἴσει. However, this seems to be incompatible with both the apparent trace of an epsilon near the end of line 1, and, more significantly, the vacats after both sigma and upsilon in line 2 (the end of line two can contain at most a three letter word after a word ending in upsilon, assuming that the right side of the stone is only lightly damaged). Assuming the restoration of the name of Serapis in line 4, then either the block itself was essentially the same width again on the left, or a second block joined to the left. It seems likely that only a very small amount is lost from the right side. One could, for instance, alternatively imagine the name of the husband in the nominative in line 2 (---της --[ο]υ) i.e. idionym ending in -της and patronym, but this does not resolve the restoration of line 1 or the first part of lines 2 or 3. It remains likely that -άδα is the accusative ending of the woman's name (alternatives such as παστάδα, and so the dedication of a building, seem implausible given the rest of the line). \u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0014a\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 1962.0388 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001282\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001282\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi 2018 Tacc. 1, p.45 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002617\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002617\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi NSA 1889 371 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1961 176-177 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001852\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001852\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Sfameni Gasparro 1973 165 no.2 tav. 1 fig.1 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001586\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001586\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Vidman 1969 no.516 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000719\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000719\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1965 189 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001841\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001841\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[583,585,587,589,591,593],{"id":387,"html":584},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">·\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]Ε[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]ΤΗΣ&nbsp;&nbsp;[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">. 7-8.\u003C/span>]Υ&nbsp;&nbsp;[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">···\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]ΑΔΑΤΑΝΑ..[...].ΝΑΙΚΑ\u003Cbr id=\"al4\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">4\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]ΚΑΙ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ΙΣΕΙ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":481,"html":586},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>  \u003Cspan>Text from autopsy\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"1\">1: \u003Cspan>Manganaro: [----]\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"2\">2: \u003Cspan>Manganaro: [- -]ΤΗΣ (vac.)
