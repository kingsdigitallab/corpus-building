c.1559 (Matritensis 5781 f.22 no.3), and as Prestianni Giallombardo (1993b: 531) has made clear, he recorded the letters P.M. at the end of line 3. Gualtherus instead marked the letter(s) after the P as unclear, and in his edition of 1624 proposed reading O after the P, which Mommsen in CIL in turn emended to a P, to give P(ater) P(atriae) (i.e. ‘father of the fatherland’, an honorific title of Augustus from 2 BC). P.M. is entirely possible however, and Augustus held the office of pontifex maximus (chief priest of the Roman state) from 12 BC onwards, which in turn provides a terminus post quem for this text, which should date therefore between 12 BC and AD 14. A parallel text is known from Haluntium (San Marco d’Alunzio), in CIL 10, no.7463 = . This is one of several texts from Sicily erected simply in the name of the municipium (compare CIL 10, no.7463= and 7464= from Haluntium; AE 1945 no.64= from Segesta), and the formulation is unusual, with occasional south Italian examples (Prag 2008: 78 nn.80-82), most likely reflecting Greek traditions of erecting honours, e.g., in the name of the polis (this possibility is made more likely by the example in Greek from Haluntium (IG 14, no.367 = , honours set up by τὸ μουνικίπιον τῶν Ἁλοντίνων). The text provides important evidence, alongside the Augustan coinage from Halaesa, that the town had the status of a Latin municipium by the later Augustan period.",[497,500,501,504,507],{"_":498,"target":499},"ISic000587","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000587",{"_":498,"target":499},{"_":502,"target":503},"ISic000588","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000588",{"_":505,"target":506},"ISic000622","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000622",{"_":508,"target":509},"ISic001190","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001190",{"_":511,"ref":512},"Agustín and Gualtherus both note the use of distinctive hollow triangular interpuncts in the text (just once in Agustín, repeatedly in Gualtherus).
