TASTI in line 2 could be part of the phrase devotus numini maiestatique, and the very faint traces of what may be letters at the beginning and end of the line are not incompatible with this, in which case an imperial honorific of the third/fourth century CE is possible (but various verbs ending -tasti are also theoretically possible). The letter forms are somewhat untypical, and it should not be ruled out that this is a post-antique text. In any case, there is no reason to think it funerary or to have any relation to the text on the obverse, which it presumably post-dates.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 1980.0528 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 76b \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Bivona 1975-1976 552 no.18b tav.9 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002140\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002140\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[465,467,469,471,473,475],{"id":114,"html":466},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]VIAIF[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]TASTI[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":426,"html":468},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"1\">1: \u003Cspan>Bivona: [---]vi(xit) a(nnis) II [---]\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"2\">2: \u003Cspan>Bivona: [---]tas ti[---]\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":436,"html":470},"\u003Ch2> translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":438,"html":472},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Bivona presents the reading of this face of this fragment (for the obverse face, see \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000155\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000155\u003C/a>) without discussion. Her reading cannot stand, since the final letter of line 1 is quite clearly an F and not a numeral, and the only possible interpunct stands after the A, such that the separation of the VIA into \"vi(xit) a(nnis)\" (an unusual splitting of the abbreviation already) is highly implausible. Similarly, the separation of letters in line 1 proposed by Bivona is arbitrary. There is no obvious restoration for the combination IF (it cannot be TF, the spacing is too narrow, compare the line below).
