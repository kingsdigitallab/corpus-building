The full name of the sevir must have stood in the latter part of line 1 and/or the first part of line 2. Manganaro (1989: 190, under no.80) suggested that this could be Aulus Mevius Zethus, known from another inscription from Halaesa () and plausibly restored the text as: Concordiae Augustae sacrum |  A(ulus) Mevius Zethus sevir Augustalis, i.e. “Sacred to Augustan Concord.

Portale (2009: 85-87) has suggested that the inscription should be associated with the statue, which would then be a representation of Concord. The statue is dated stylistically to the early Antonine period (140s BC), about a generation earlier than the statue of Ceres. Such a date would be entirely compatible with the form of the inscription, which could be later first or second century AD (and that of Mevius Zethus could be first or second century also).
