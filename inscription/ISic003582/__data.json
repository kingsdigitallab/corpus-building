The stroke visible just above the letter at the left margin is later damage and not a letter stroke. The final stroke of the M is lost. The most likely possibilities for this combination of letters in such a monumental text are consummare (common in describing completion of an undertaking or building) and consumere (common in describing a building damaged / destroyed and now replaced / rebuilt); mensum and censum might also be possible.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The text belongs to the first, second, or earlier third century AD.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The fragments have some similarity to \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003580\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003580\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003581\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003581\u003C/a>, but they should be treated separately for a number of reasons: the letter forms are distinct in their style (narrower, shallower, with finer serifs, and rounded at the junction of two upright strokes, as in V and M, which is also off-vertical here but vertical in the other two), the type of stone is not identical, and the form of the stone is different in both thickness and the moulding at the lower edge.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":409,"html":433},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.12 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":435,"html":436},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
