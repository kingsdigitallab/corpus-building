Unlike the other five, it was not subsequently recorded by later visitors to the site (cf. e.g. Gualtherus 1624) and has not been seen or recorded since until the edition of Prestianni Giallombardo (1987). There is good reason to believe that Agustín recorded the letter forms accurately, and if so these provide some grounds for a date: the letter forms are comparable to those in the funerary inscription of Eirena (late fourth or fifth century AD) and Prestianni Giallombardo notes Syracusan parallels from the first third of the fifth century AD (1987: 303 n.24). However a substantially later date is also possible, and Prestianni Giallombardo notes firstly that the name Tobias is rare in Sicily, and likely to indicate an immigrant from the eastern Mediterranean, and secondly that there is limited evidence for a bishopric at Halaesa from the seventh century onwards. On this basis she plausibly suggests that Tobias was bishop at Halaesa in the course of the seventh century AD, and the inscription therefore records his construction of a building of some description on the site.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 41.0776 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 1988-1989 363-365 dr \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001662\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001662\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 1987 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001663\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001663\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Facella 2006 306-307 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.49 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[53,56,59,62,65,68],{"id":54,"html":55},"edition","  \u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\">  \u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"error\" title=\"hi tag with rend=stacked is not supported!\">Τω\u003C/span>βίας · ἐπίσ(κοπος) \u003Cbr id=\"al2\">ἔκτισεν \u003C/span>\u003C/div>  ",{"id":57,"html":58},"apparatus","\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cp>  \u003Cspan class=\"\">\u003Cspan>Text after Prestianni\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003Cspan class=\"Line 1\">\u003Cspan>Τ is directly above ω in the transcription\u003C/span>\u003C/span>  \u003C/p>",{"id":60,"html":61},"translation","\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Bishop Tobias founded (this)\u003C/p>  ",{"id":63,"html":64},"commentary","\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The text is one of six that Antonio Agustín recorded as having seen in the church of S.
