this inscription and its partner () remains that by Tusa (1963), which was never picked up in SEG and Tusa's text has simply been reproduced in subsequent discussions and presentations (e.g. Dimartino or in EDR). The text is however far from perfectly preserved, and Tusa's reading, particularly of ISic001413, should not go unchallenged. Most fundamentally, Tusa's reading of the patronym Ἀπ[ολλωνίου] in line 1 of ISic001413 cannot stand: I read Ἀρίστ[ωνος] (the traces of the first five letters are reasonably secure), and this would therefore mean that the eponymous priest in that text is the same man as in this text, confirming the general assumption that this is a contemporary double dedication. However, it requires that the family relationships identified by Tusa in his original publication be reconsidered. Consequently, applying Occam's razor, to keep the number of individuals to a minimum, it would appear that (a) the eponymous hierothytes (Philon, son of Ariston) is identical in line 1 of both this text and ISic001413; (b) in this text, it is the eponymous priest Philon and his two brothers who honour their father, Ariston son of Apollonios; (c) the honorand and amphipolos in this text (Ariston, son of Apollonios) is in turn the dedicant of ISic001413, there honouring his own father (Apollonios son of Ariston), the grandfather of the eponymous priest Philon. Although this does entail that three generations appear to be active simultaneously (although it is perhaps not strictly necessary that the grandfather, honoured in ISic001413, had held the position of amphipolos particularly recently, only that the father, honoured in this text had done so?), it appears the most logical resolution of the relationships described, and implies a strong grip on the local honours over several generations by one family, not dissimilar to the position of the family of Antallos which appears in several other Soluntum inscriptions of the same period (e.g. ).",[563,565],{"_":25,"target":564},"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001413",{"_":566,"target":567},"ISic001130","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001130","The chronology has been much debated, but the inscription itself can hardly serve to resolve debates about the date of the monumentalisation of the agora or the city more broadly, and any date for the inscription should almost certainly be subordinated to the archaeological dating of the structures - for which the current consensus leans to the second century BCE (Wolf) or more specifically the later second century (Portale).
