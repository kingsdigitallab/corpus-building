The tomb itself, with 3 stone couches, appears to have been constructed for wealthy inhumation burials in the fourth or early third century BCE. It appears that the tomb was re-used in the third century for multiple cremation burials, before subsequently suffering a collapse; a later burial (1st century BCE) in the dromos suggests a terminus ante quem for the period of re-use.
