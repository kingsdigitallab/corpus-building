However, the anchoring of the stratagoi list in absolute terms is less certain, even if the start date is generally agreed to fall somewhere in the middle or later third century BCE. If that date is accepted, and assuming the identification of the stratagos with the individual honoured here, then the date should fall somewhere in the first half or middle of the second century BCE. However, Battistoni (2020 p.176) rejects the identification, on the grounds that in his view the palaeography of this inscription is incompatible with such a date (he considers it to be palaeographically more recent than the base for Marcellus of the 70s BCE, IG XIV.435 = ). Palaeographic arguments seem weak in this context (and contrast the discussion of Muscolino 2009-2010, pp. 440-444, who reaches similar conclusions to those presented here) and the identification seems plausible, suggesting therefore a date between, very approximately, 200 and 140 BCE.","#julian","-0200","-0050","lettering prosopography",[258,261],{"_":259,"target":260},"ISic001246","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001246",{"_":262,"target":263},"ISic001260","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001260",[265,272],{"_":266,"type":74,"subtype":75,"when":267,"ref":268,"geo":271},"Found in situ during excavations in 1978 of the area of the Roman period baths behind the Caserma dei Carabinieri, which revealed this and a second base () in situ in the area of a courtyard adjoining a substantial hellenistic structure (possibly the bouleuterion), subsequently covered over in the restructuring of the area in the late C1 BCE / early C1 CE.
