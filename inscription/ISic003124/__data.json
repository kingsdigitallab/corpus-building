However, the anchoring of the stratagoi list in absolute terms is less certain, even if the start date is generally agreed to fall somewhere in the middle or later third century BCE. If that date is accepted, and assuming the identification of the stratagos with the individual honoured here, then the date should fall somewhere in the first half or middle of the second century BCE. However, Battistoni (2020 p.176) rejects the identification, on the grounds that in his view the palaeography of this inscription is incompatible with such a date (he considers it to be palaeographically more recent than the base for Marcellus of the 70s BCE, IG XIV.435 = ). Palaeographic arguments seem weak in this context (and contrast the discussion of Muscolino 2009-2010, pp. 440-444, who reaches similar conclusions to those presented here) and the identification seems plausible, suggesting therefore a date between, very approximately, 200 and 140

While the bases can all confidently be dated to the period between c.200 and 50 BCE, the exact chronology, as noted above, is open to some dispute. For a very full and detailed discussion of the context, concentrated on the two bases known since the 18th century, see Muscolino 2009-2010.",[532,533,536],{"_":95,"target":96},{"_":534,"target":535},"ISic001259","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001259",{"_":327,"target":328},"It is worth comparing the variety in the formulation of these four bases. The base for Nymphodoros son of Philistion is the only example at Tauromenion to employ the full formula dedicating the honorand in the accusative to the divine in the dative (in this case 'all the gods', which is encountered with some frequency in Hellenistic Sicily, especially along the north coast of the island). The base for Nymphodoros son of Eukleides employs the same accusative formulation, but without the dative dedication to a divinity, or the reflexive phrase τᾶς εἰς αὑτὸν, in similar fashion to the base for Olympis son of Olympis (which substitutes his Pythian victory as the reason, rather than his goodwill to the city). The base for Marcellus simply presents the name of the Roman governor in the nominative.",{"type":539,"listBibl":540},"bibliography",[541,552],{"type":130,"bibl":542},[543,546,549],{"type":133,"n":134,"citedRange":135,"ptr":544,"ref":545},{"target":137},{"_":139,"target":139},{"author":143,"date":144,"citedRange":145,"ptr":547,"ref":548},{"target":147},{"_":149,"target":149},{"author":153,"date":154,"citedRange":155,"ptr":550,"ref":551},{"target":157},{"_":159,"target":159},{"type":163,"bibl":553},{"author":166,"date":167,"citedRange":168,"ptr":554,"ref":555},{"target":170},{"_":172,"target":172},[557,558,559,560,561,562],{"n":421,"url":107,"height":422,"width":423,"desc":108,"surfaceType":418},{"n":421,"url":428,"height":422,"width":423,"desc":108,"surfaceType":418},{"n":421,"url":432,"height":422,"width":423,"desc":108,"surfaceType":418},{"n":421,"url":439,"height":422,"width":423,"desc":108,"surfaceType":436},{"n":421,"url":443,"height":422,"width":423,"desc":108,"surfaceType":436},{"n":421,"url":450,"height":422,"width":423,"desc":108,"surfaceType":447},{"title":564,"body":565,"divs":566,"images":580},"ISic003124.
