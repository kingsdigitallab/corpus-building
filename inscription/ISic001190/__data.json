Autopsy based readings have been attempted seemingly by Gualtherus in 1624, by Dessau as reported in Kaibel 1890, by Manni Piriano 1974, and by Korhonen and Soraci 2019; additionally Salinas reports the reading of Gualtherus but with minor variation consequent upon his interpretation of what Gualtherus printed. Previous readings are not consistently presented (and Korhonen-Soraci report with underlining, as if read by previous editors, letters which in a number of cases were never read, only conjecturally restored by those authors [when Gualtherus prints italic lower case, these are conjectural restorations, not readings]). The stone has presumably deteriorated since seen by Gualtherus, but he already clearly struggled to read it. The reading presented here is based upon c.2 hours of study under raking light on a late  December afternoon / evening. It is quite possible that the application of RTI or SfM could produce a better reading. The previous readings present considerable variety as can be seen in the apparatus, but it will be apparent that the essential crux is the second half of line 3. Given  in line 4, the second half of the line must contain the individual's patronymic. Gualtherus saw something similar to the nomen Pollienos in the first half of the line, but his reading of the rest of the line is very uncertain; Kaibel/Dessau interpreted the angular strokes in the second half of the line as ΜΑ, reading Eumarea, whereas Manni Piraino took it to be ΛΛ, and read a repetition of the nomen Pollienos. The latter would be very unusual for a Roman filiation, as Korhonen-Soraci observed. Korhonen-Soraci claimed to be able to read the letters ΝΑΙΟ followed tentatively by Υ at line end, and so, on the basis of ΓΝΑΙΟΝ in line 2, read Γ̣να̣ίο̣υ̣.  They argued that the four oblique lines visible in this part of the line (read as Μ by Kaibel/Dessau, and as ΛΛ by Manni Piraino) should be read so, but that the final of these on the right was part of a Ν. The problem with this reading is that it simply ignores the remaining oblique lines, and these are undeniably present and incompatible with N, in the absence of vertical strokes. I print above what I believe to be legible on the stone, although with limited confidence, and without any easy solution, while noting that it aligns partially with the readings of both Kaibel and Manni Piraino. The very end of the line is entirely illegible. It is not easy to resolve these traces as a Roman praenomen, and yet it is obviously tempting to associate this Gnaios Pollieonos with the Gnaeus Pollienus Cn.f. attested at Thermae Himeraeae in  and , as noted by previous scholars. If the patronymic is something else, then this potentially becomes a first generation Roman citizen, presumably with some relationship to the Pollienus family at Termini.",{"_":591,"xml:lang":113},[629,632],{"_":630,"target":631},"ISic000095","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000095",{"_":633,"target":634},"ISic000096","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000096",{"_":636,"foreign":637},"The formula  is somewhat curious, assuming that the reading is correct: the penultimate letter of the first word is far from clear, Manni Piraino read instead εὐεργέτη̣ν, but it is difficult to make sense of two accusatives in sequence. Parallels for the formulation here can be found in inscriptions from Samos (e.g. IG XII.6.1.296) and Didyma (I.Didyma 259). The implication, in turn, is that Pollienos presumably had a longer familial relationship with the community, and perhaps aligns therefore with the possibility that he is a first generation Roman citizen, of local birth, rather than identical with the individual from Thermae Himeraeae, given that this inscription surely dates no later than the Augustan period, and therefore cannot be later than the first generation of colonial settlers at Thermae Himeraeae of whom Cn. Pollienus Cn.f. must be a part.",{"_":638,"xml:lang":113},"εὐεργέτων ἀπόγονον",{"_":640,"foreign":641,"ref":643},"The inscription's principal point of interest however lies in the use of the calque . This is usually assumed to reflect the town's assumption of municipal status following upon the grant of Latin rights by Caesar, although whether to be dated therefore narrowly to the period between Caesar's grant c.46 BCE and the conquest of the island by Octavian in 36 BCE, as argued e.g. by Giacomo Manganaro, or rather to reflect the continuation or resumption of that status under Augustus is unclear (municipal status being attested in a number of other Sicilian towns in the Augustan period, and that status is normally assumed to be Latin, not full Roman status). The shift towards the use of Latin in inscriptions is rapid in the Augustan period, but as this text indicates, by no means certain or universal in the first generation or so of the transition.
