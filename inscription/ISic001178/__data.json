omitted by accident in the transcription or already invisible on the stone) and restored it, as here. The text has the usual form of a compressed dedicatory honorific typical at Halaesa and ubiquitous in the Hellenistic world. It is however unusual, in comparison to the other Halaesan and Sicilian examples in two respects: firstly, the order of honorand and dedicant is reversed, with the city coming second, the Roman magistrate being named first; and secondly, it omits the reference to the deity in the dative to which the likely statue of the honorand is dedicated (typically, at Halaesa, ‘to all the gods’, although this is not always present; compare , , , also ). Both these differences are well attested in wider practice (see e.g. J. Ma, Statutes and Cities (Oxford 2013), 25), although they may be indicative of the fact that the honorand is the powerful figure of a Roman magistrate and that the text is a relatively late one (at Halaesa, compare the two lost Latin honorifics: that honouring Scipio (), which is second century BC, and uses the accusative for the honorand, in typical Greek form, but where the honorand comes second; and that for Augustus (), where the honorand is in dative, in typical Latin practice, but comes first, as here).",[540,543,546,549,552,555],{"_":541,"target":542},"ISic000770","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000770",{"_":544,"target":545},"ISic001177","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001177",{"_":547,"target":548},"ISic000612","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000612",{"_":550,"target":551},"ISic001176","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001176",{"_":553,"target":554},"ISic000583","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000583",{"_":556,"target":557},"ISic000582","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000582",{"_":559,"ref":560}," was praetor in 62 BC and praetorian governor of Sicily from 61-58 BC.
