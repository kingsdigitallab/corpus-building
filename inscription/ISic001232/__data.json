earlier scholars and the various vicissitudes of the two attested fragments, of which the upper (a) was lost and then rediscovered by A.

Torremuzza resolved the fundamental problems of the text's history, which were then partly obscured again by Kaibel, and effectively resumed by Manni Piraino. However, the presentation of the text of (b), for which the surviving tradition rests in the transcription made by Gualtherus, is not entirely reliable at any point in the subsequent tradition, with minor points of arbitrary alteration already in the text of Torremuzza. The tendency of editors to present the text of the second fragment only according to the prosody of the verses, rather than the layout of the text on the stone increases the confusion.","Gualtherus reported two texts in nos. 22 and 28 of the Messina edition, both derived from the manuscript of Alberto Piccoli, and at the time described as lost. No. 28 is lines 1-3 of fragment (a), presented as a distinct funerary inscription; no.22 is lines 4ff of frag (a) together with a version of the text of frag (b). Subsequently, Gualtherus actually saw fragment (b) and presented a better text of this in the addenda to the Messina edition, at p.101 no.7. Torremuzza, in turn, was made aware of the entirety of the text of fragment (a), when it was found by Andrea Gallo who sent him a transcription. This enabled Torremuzza to recognise that Gualtherus' nos. 28 in fact stands as the first three lines before the text of Gualtherus' no. 22, and that the latter part of no.22 should be superseded by the version recorded by Gualtherus as p.101 no.7. The text of fragment (a) is secure, and the stone, previously in Messina and then the museum of S. Martino delle Scale (Monreale), is now in Palermo Museum; a gap of uncertain length follows line 11 of fragment (a); the text then resumes, on the basis of the transcription by Gualtherus (p.101 no.7), which has been variously amended by subsequent scholars. As Manni Piraino notes, Kaibel wrongly attributed the entire text as presented by Torremuzza to A. Gallo.","The text consists of a brief record of the dedicant, Aurelius Eutyches, followed by the typical abbreviated dedication to the spirits of the underworld and then a verse epigram recording the Cyzicene youths, drowned in a shipwreck, whom he buried.

Gallo, and still survives; while the lower, (b) was seemingly lost, then rediscovered by Gualtherus, and subsequently lost again (and is still lost). Torremuzza resolved the fundamental problems of the text's history, which were then partly obscured again by Kaibel, and effectively resumed by Manni Piraino. However, the presentation of the text of (b), for which the surviving tradition rests in the transcription made by Gualtherus, is not entirely reliable at any point in the subsequent tradition, with minor points of arbitrary alteration already in the text of Torremuzza. The tendency of editors to present the text of the second fragment only according to the prosody of the verses, rather than the layout of the text on the stone increases the confusion.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>Gualtherus reported two texts in nos. 22 and 28 of the Messina edition, both derived from the manuscript of Alberto Piccoli, and at the time described as lost. No. 28 is lines 1-3 of fragment (a), presented as a distinct funerary inscription; no.22 is lines 4ff of frag (a) together with a version of the text of frag (b). Subsequently, Gualtherus actually saw fragment (b) and presented a better text of this in the addenda to the Messina edition, at p.101 no.7. Torremuzza, in turn, was made aware of the entirety of the text of fragment (a), when it was found by Andrea Gallo who sent him a transcription. This enabled Torremuzza to recognise that Gualtherus' nos. 28 in fact stands as the first three lines before the text of Gualtherus' no. 22, and that the latter part of no.22 should be superseded by the version recorded by Gualtherus as p.101 no.7. The text of fragment (a) is secure, and the stone, previously in Messina and then the museum of S. Martino delle Scale (Monreale), is now in Palermo Museum; a gap of uncertain length follows line 11 of fragment (a); the text then resumes, on the basis of the transcription by Gualtherus (p.101 no.7), which has been variously amended by subsequent scholars. As Manni Piraino notes, Kaibel wrongly attributed the entire text as presented by Torremuzza to A. Gallo.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The text consists of a brief record of the dedicant, Aurelius Eutyches, followed by the typical abbreviated dedication to the spirits of the underworld and then a verse epigram recording the Cyzicene youths, drowned in a shipwreck, whom he buried. The stele itself, and its lettering is finely carved. On the basis of the dimensions of fragment (a), it is likely that the stele as a whole was approximately 1 metre tall.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":599,"html":636},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 [1625] no.22, no.28 and p.101 no.7 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0405\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 27 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000531\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000531\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 3.5626 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1784 cl.14 no.20 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":638,"html":639},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
