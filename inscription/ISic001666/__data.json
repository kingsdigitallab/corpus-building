The mixed use of interpuncts is curious and appears to bear little relation to the words. The punct after the A might suggest the praenomen A(ulus), but in that case the vacat after 'per' implies the omission of the rest of the nomen (?Perpenna?) from the inscription, with Augurinus as the cognomen. The alternative is to read simply 'Aper', which although rare is attested as a name.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":415,"html":443},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Orsi NSA 1889 386 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> VIII 687 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002649\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002649\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":445,"html":446},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
