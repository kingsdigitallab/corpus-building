A Thesmophorion was would be found in Bitalemi (see Orlandini 1966). Of interest is the term σκανά, variously interpreted by editors. According to Orlandini, the term refers to the wooden building which served to house the women participating in the Thesmophoria, and whose base was found in mud bricks at Bitalemi. More plausible is the interpretation of Dubois (IGDS 1, no. 155), according to whom the term designates by metonymy the group of women, in this case under the direction of Dikaio, who took part in the Thesmoforia. The scholar in fact points out that in the regulation of Halaesa (no. 196, ll.39-46) the term σκανά designates a landmark in the territory, so it must have been a fairly solid building (however, it should be noted that even if this skana had been a wooden building, given its importance in the sacred landscape, it would still have been a landmark. Dubois again notes that in the sacred law of Elatea (LSCG no. 82 ), the verb σκᾱνε͂ν has the sense of θοινᾶσθαι \"to take part in a ceremonial meal\". So the group of women who took part in the Thesmophoria and conducted their ritual functions in this building, which was also used for ceremonial banquets, were perhaps designated - precisely by metonymy - by the name of the building itself, which would thus serve as a collective name in our text.
