The scholar in fact points out that in the regulation of Halaesa (no. 196, ll.39-46) the term σκανά designates a landmark in the territory, so it must have been a fairly solid building (however, it should be noted that even if this skana had been a wooden building, given its importance in the sacred landscape, it would still have been a landmark. Dubois again notes that in the sacred law of Elatea (LSCG no. 82 ), the verb σκᾱνε͂ν has the sense of θοινᾶσθαι \"to take part in a ceremonial meal\". So the group of women who took part in the Thesmophoria and conducted their ritual functions in this building, which was also used for ceremonial banquets, were perhaps designated - precisely by metonymy - by the name of the building itself, which would thus serve as a collective name in our text. The name of a woman Δικαιώ is also well attested: in Thessaly (IG \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1729590\" target=\"_blank\">9.0156\u003C/a>), Athens (IG \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/2155411\" target=\"_blank\">2.9064\u003C/a>) and in Bouthrôtos in Epirus.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":385,"html":422},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Arena 2002 46a, pl.
