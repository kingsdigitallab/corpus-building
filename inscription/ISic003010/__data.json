Manganaro's correction back to Υ in 1977 is correct, unaware of Orsi's original reading. The trace is visible in the photograph in Manganaro 1977. The restoration of [Ἀγαθῶ]ι goes back to Kaibel; of [--κλ]εος to Manganaro. Manganaro notes that a name such as Κρύτων or Βρύτων might stand at the end of line 4; but a relative pronoun in the genitive plural is surely at least as plausible.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0005a\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 34.0988 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Cavallari NSA 1886 466 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi 2018 Tacc. 1, p.44 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002617\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002617\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi NSA 1889 370 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1977 155-156 fig. 7 tav. 46.6 \u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[460,462,464,466,468,470],{"id":359,"html":461},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[.....]ΙΔΑΙΜΟΝΙ\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>..]ΕΟΣΟΙΥΙΟΙ\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]ΗΣΙΜΟΣ\u003Cbr id=\"al4\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">4\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>].ΤΩΝ\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":388,"html":463},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>  \u003Cspan>Text as in Manganaro 1977\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"3\">3: \u003Cspan>Cavallari: -]ΣΙΜΟΣ\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"4\">4: \u003Cspan>Cavallari: -]ΤΩΝ; Kaibel: [Ἀρί]στων\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":398,"html":465},"\u003Ch2> translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":400,"html":467},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Wrongly attributed to Tauromenium in SEG (presumably due to a misreading of the reference to the type of stone). The text was published twice in NSA, firstly by Fiorelli/Cavallari, on the basis of a squeeze taken by Cavallari, and subsequently by Orsi, based upon autopsy (with a transcription by hand recorded in the first of his Taccuini). In Orsi's transcription, the remains of upsilon at the start of line 4 is clearly indicated, but omitted by Fiorelli/Cavallari. Kaibel's reading of στων for the final line appears to be based upon the unsatisfactory published version of Orsi's transcription in NSA 1889. Manganaro's correction back to Υ in 1977 is correct, unaware of Orsi's original reading. The trace is visible in the photograph in Manganaro 1977. The restoration of [Ἀγαθῶ]ι goes back to Kaibel; of [--κλ]εος to Manganaro.
