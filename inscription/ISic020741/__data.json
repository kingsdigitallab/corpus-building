The burials were contained in two clay sarcophagi. The vessels found in the tomb can be divided into two groups (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, 194): large Attic (imported) drinking vessels (cups, 'stemless cups', a skyphos, i.e. luxury vessels, typically related to the consumption of wine in the symposium); vessels of different types, all of a smaller size. To the first group, the drinking vessels, belong 7 vases in total, of which 3 belong to the deceased in the front of the chamber, 4 to the second, in the back. The inscriptions of this first group show what appear to be names, perhaps bimember onomastic formulae, followed by a termination -mi that could be (cf. Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, p. 195) an aphaeretic form of the verb εἰμί, not known in Greek epigraphic culture but perhaps adapted by the writers of Montagna di Marzo in correspondence with syntactic structures proper to their language. In this case we would therefore have 'mares kaka' as the onomastic formula + -mi, an epigraphic formula that could be comparable to the Greek ownership inscriptions and the name inscribed could be that of one of the two deceased in the tomb. The latter hypothesis is also confirmed by the presence of the same inscription on two other vessels, one identical, another without -mi.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":395,"html":432},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani Forthcoming MMA?? \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Mussinano 1970 no. 3, p. 172, pl.
