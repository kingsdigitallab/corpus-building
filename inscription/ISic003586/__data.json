Iulius Philippus (see Peachin, M. 1990. Roman Imperial Titulature and Chronology, A.D. 235-284. Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben and Peachin, M. 1990. Roman Imperial Titulature and Chronology, A.D. 235-284. Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben), and the omission of the word filius would be unusual (it is unusual to delay it to the end of the full name of the father as must be the case here, but parallels can be cited, such as \u003Ca href=\"http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/IRT048.html\" target=\"_blank\">IRT no.48\u003C/a>). It is, however, impossible to know how many lines are lost in the lacuna, and how standard or not this text may have been, given that some variation from the most common parallels is already visible, such as the omission of Caesar from the title of Philippus (pater) in line 4 (but see e.g. \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/190683\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1981 no.743\u003C/a>). On the other hand, it is unlikely that much more than the rest of the basic nomenclature of Philippus is missing. It is difficult to restore letters to the sequence of letter feet preserved at the start of the preserved line 6, but they are not incompatible with the titolature just noted, and the letters FIL would fit particularly well. The final letter on line 7 is clearly a D, and is clearly centred from the left margin, and so is most obviously compatible with the standard formula D(ecreto) D(ecurionum) of a public honorific.
