It is, however, impossible to know how many lines are lost in the lacuna, and how standard or not this text may have been, given that some variation from the most common parallels is already visible, such as the omission of Caesar from the title of Philippus (pater) in line 4 (but see e.g. \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/190683\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1981 no.743\u003C/a>). On the other hand, it is unlikely that much more than the rest of the basic nomenclature of Philippus is missing. It is difficult to restore letters to the sequence of letter feet preserved at the start of the preserved line 6, but they are not incompatible with the titolature just noted, and the letters FIL would fit particularly well.
