The traces at the start of line 3 cannot be resolved with certainty; Manganaro suggested [Halaes]ịṇị, as those responsible for the honorific, although such a phrase might be expected at the end of the text and the ethnic in the genitive plural (after e.g. res publica or similar). Manganaro also plausibly suggested that optimo was followed in the next line by civi ac patrono, i.e. ‘excellent citizen and patron’, which would make the honorand a citizen of Halaesa who had achieved high imperial office. As Scibona observed, the form of the letters (and the use of the term clarissimus vir) place this text in the third (or fourth) century.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 1973.0274 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Scibona 1971 20 no.10 fig.3 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001599\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001599\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1988 88 no.37 n.490 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Facella 2006 294 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Scibona 2008 27 ph \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001593\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001593\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 2012 184 fig.178 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.33 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[497,499,501,503,505,507],{"id":108,"html":498},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]IDI.[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">·\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>].PROCOSCV\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">··\u003C/span>.OPTIMO\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":455,"html":500},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from autopsy (Prag)\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":460,"html":502},"\u003Ch2> translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":462,"html":504},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The text is an honorific for an individual of proconsular rank, since the titles proconsul and clarissimus vir and the epithet optimo all appear in the dative. The curve of a letter is visible at the end of line 1 on the break (not noted by the original editor) and while this could in theory be a C, in context it must be an O (as Manganaro noted). Since there is space for no more than one more letter at the edge of the stone, this is presumably the end of a name in –idius, followed by a blank space. The traces at the start of line 3 cannot be resolved with certainty; Manganaro suggested [Halaes]ịṇị, as those responsible for the honorific, although such a phrase might be expected at the end of the text and the ethnic in the genitive plural (after e.g. res publica or similar).
