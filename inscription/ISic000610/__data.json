date has been much disputed, there seems to be no good reason to doubt the original suggestion of the first editor, Antonino Di Vita, that it should be attributed to the activities of Caius Aurelius Cotta, consul and commander in Sicily during the First Punic War in 252 and again in 248 BCE (as argued in Prag 2006). Degrassi argued against this on the grounds of orthography, preferring to attribute it to one of the Aurelii Cotta known to have been consul in the second century BCE (and has been followed most recently in this by Kreiler 2011). However, it is implausible that any of those consuls could have been active in Sicily, while the historical context of Aurelius and Rome's military activities in western Sicily following the capture of Agrigento in 262 BCE, interior settlements such as Hippana (Montagna di Cavalli) in 258, and Palermo itself in 254 BCE, provide the single most plausible historical moment for Roman consolidation of this land route (NB Polybius 1.39.11-13). The text displays several features of interest, most notably the very early presence of gemination of the consonant in Cotta, which was the principal motivation for Degrassi's later date, but which is perhaps best explained with reference in turn to the unusual Greek-influenced nominative termination in -as, and the two together imply the influence of Greek (compare the other early instance of gemination in the Sicilian placename 'Hinnad' (= Henna = Enna) in a dedication by the consul Marcellus in 211 BCE (ILLRP 295), explained by Degrassi on precisely the grounds of Greek influence). For the likely route of the road, from Agrigento to Palermo (with this marker standing at 57 miles from Agrigento), see above all .",{"_":512,"target":513},"Giovanni Uggeri, La viabilità della Sicilia in età romana, Galatina: M.

Degrassi argued against this on the grounds of orthography, preferring to attribute it to one of the Aurelii Cotta known to have been consul in the second century BCE (and has been followed most recently in this by Kreiler 2011). However, it is implausible that any of those consuls could have been active in Sicily, while the historical context of Aurelius and Rome's military activities in western Sicily following the capture of Agrigento in 262 BCE, interior settlements such as Hippana (Montagna di Cavalli) in 258, and Palermo itself in 254 BCE, provide the single most plausible historical moment for Roman consolidation of this land route (NB Polybius 1.39.11-13). The text displays several features of interest, most notably the very early presence of gemination of the consonant in Cotta, which was the principal motivation for Degrassi's later date, but which is perhaps best explained with reference in turn to the unusual Greek-influenced nominative termination in -as, and the two together imply the influence of Greek (compare the other early instance of gemination in the Sicilian placename 'Hinnad' (= Henna = Enna) in a dedication by the consul Marcellus in 211 BCE (ILLRP 295), explained by Degrassi on precisely the grounds of Greek influence).
