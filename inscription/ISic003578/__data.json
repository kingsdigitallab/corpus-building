Despite the loss of the lower part of the line, the reading is clear except at the very end of the line. The lack of space towards the line-end has led the engraver to link the top of the S and the T, effectively in ligature. The final two letters are less certain: there are three separate marks preserved; the first is clearly a triangular apex, and surely an A; the second mark looks to be incidental damage rather than part of a letter stroke (the compression of letters would be extreme if it were part of a letter); the final mark looks to be a very short horizontal, with an upward serif at the end, which is most compatible with the top of an E, albeit a very short one, to be explained by the desire of the engraver to fit the word in before the edge of the stone. Priestesses of the Augusta are more commonly described as sacerdos divae Augustae, but instances of sacerdos Augustae are also attested (e.g. \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/514268\" target=\"_blank\">ILS 6486\u003C/a>, Aeclanum; \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/261126\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1998 no. 416\u003C/a>, Interamnia Praetuttiorum; \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/250392\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1971 no.79\u003C/a>, Formiae).
