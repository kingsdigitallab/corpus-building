This reconstruction demonstrates that one block is\n                    missing between the two surviving blocks of the crown of the base, and that the missing block was 60\n                    cm wide (with the same height (35 cm) and depth (47 cm across the base and 68 cm across the top with\n                    the moulding) as the other two blocks). The lacuna therefore between the two surviving parts of the\n                    text was 60 cm. In line 1, this lacuna was almost certainly filled by the word et (‘and’) and the\n                    praenomen and nomen of the second individual with the cognomen Sabinus. In line 2, the presence of a\n                    gap before and after the word seviri suggests that there were fewer, widely spaced words in line 2.\n                    Two possibilities can be suggested: either the name in the accusative of the divinity to whom the\n                    monument was dedicated, and whom the statue or statue group on top depicted (e.g. AE 1990\n                    no.225-226, a dedication to Victoria Augusta at Iuvanum in Samnium); or else just the word\n                    Augustales, i.e. seviri Augustales (e.g. AE 2007 no.698, Huesca in Spain and AE 1981 no.345,\n                    Etruria).","The gens Caecilia is attested at Halaesa in Cicero (Verr. 2.2.23, Q.
