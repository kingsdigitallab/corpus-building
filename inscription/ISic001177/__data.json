Both names are well attested in Sicily, including at Halaesa (see LGPN). The incomplete word which follows the name could be the beginning of a demotic-type abbreviation, which is commonly found in Halaesan inscriptions, although none beginning ΚΑ- are currently known; it could also be a second name in the Sicilian Greek tradition (cf. Cordano 1997 and 1999: 152-154). Both the men serving as soldiers (presumably citizens of Halaesa) and the commander, described as a chiliarch, are recorded as serving at Eryx (modern Erice), where there was a major sanctuary of Astarte / Aphrodite / Venus. Diodorus Siculus (4.83.7) records that the Roman senate decreed “that the 17 most loyal cities in Sicily should wear gold in Aphrodite’s honour and that 200 soldiers should watch over the sanctuary.” Diodorus does not date this decree, but it is most likely to belong to the period immediately after the First Punic War (Prag 2011: 195-197). Two other inscriptions found at Eryx ( and ) also record soldiers and commanders at Eryx, and it is a reasonable assumption that all three inscriptions relate to this special garrison, and that this text records soldiers from Halaesa serving in the garrison.  records a Segestan also holding the position of chiliarch; the fact that our text was set up in Halaesa, makes it very likely that Herakleios was a Halaesan holding the same position.  describes the (unknown) commander of the same garrison as a tribunus militum and the Greek title chiliarch is the usual translation for this Roman position (it is interesting to see Greek citizens adopting a Roman military title). The presence of this text at Halaesa also implies that Halaesa was one of the 17 loyal cities mentioned by Diodorus and by Cicero (Verr.5.124), which fits with the city’s privileged status under Rome (see Pais 1888: 173-194 for the fullest discussion of this group, and Prag 2007b: 82-83 on the garrison).",[649,652,655,656],{"_":650,"target":651},"ISic001101","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001101",{"_":653,"target":654},"ISic000538","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000538",{"_":650,"target":651},{"_":653,"target":654},{"_":658,"ref":659},"The inscription finds a local parallel in , in which citizens of Halaesa and several other communities honour a Roman commander; a further parallel from Halaesa is offered by an as yet unpublished text in which cavalrymen from several cities including Halaesa honour an unknown individual.",{"_":660,"target":661},"ISic000612","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000612"," The text cannot be closely dated, but belongs in the period between 241 and 49 BC.",{"type":664,"listBibl":665},"bibliography",[666,725],{"type":107,"bibl":667},[668,673,676,679,680,683,686,689,692,695,698,701,704,707,710,713,716,719,722],{"type":110,"n":111,"citedRange":669,"ptr":671,"ref":672},{"ref":670},{"_":114,"target":115},{"target":117},{"_":119,"target":119},{"type":121,"n":122,"citedRange":123,"ptr":674,"ref":675},{"target":125},{"_":127,"target":127},{"type":121,"n":122,"citedRange":129,"ptr":677,"ref":678},{"target":125},{"_":127,"target":127},{"author":133,"date":134,"citedRange":135},{"author":133,"date":137,"citedRange":138,"ptr":681,"ref":682},{"target":140},{"_":142,"target":142},{"author":144,"date":145,"citedRange":146,"ptr":684,"ref":685},{"target":148},{"_":150,"target":150},{"author":152,"date":153,"citedRange":154,"ptr":687,"ref":688},{"target":156},{"_":158,"target":158},{"author":152,"date":160,"citedRange":161,"ptr":690,"ref":691},{"target":163},{"_":165,"target":165},{"author":152,"date":167,"citedRange":168,"ptr":693,"ref":694},{"target":170},{"_":172,"target":172},{"type":110,"n":174,"citedRange":175,"ptr":696,"ref":697},{"target":177},{"_":179,"target":179},{"type":110,"n":181,"citedRange":182,"ptr":699,"ref":700},{"target":184},{"_":186,"target":186},{"type":110,"n":188,"citedRange":189,"ptr":702,"ref":703},{"target":191},{"_":193,"target":193},{"author":195,"date":196,"ptr":705,"ref":706},{"target":198},{"_":200,"target":200},{"author":195,"date":202,"citedRange":203,"ptr":708,"ref":709},{"target":205},{"_":207,"target":207},{"author":209,"date":210,"ptr":711,"ref":712},{"target":212},{"_":214,"target":214},{"author":216,"date":217,"citedRange":218,"ptr":714,"ref":715},{"target":220},{"_":222,"target":222},{"author":224,"date":225,"citedRange":226,"ptr":717,"ref":718},{"target":228},{"_":230,"target":230},{"author":195,"date":232,"citedRange":233,"ptr":720,"ref":721},{"target":235},{"_":237,"target":237},{"author":239,"date":240,"citedRange":241,"ptr":723,"ref":724},{"target":243},{"_":245,"target":245},{"type":247,"bibl":32},[727,728,729,730,731],{"n":480,"url":92,"height":481,"width":482,"desc":93,"surfaceType":477},{"n":480,"url":487,"height":488,"width":489,"desc":93,"surfaceType":477},{"n":480,"url":493,"height":494,"width":495,"desc":93,"surfaceType":477},{"n":480,"url":502,"height":495,"width":494,"desc":93,"surfaceType":499},{"n":480,"url":509,"height":510,"width":511,"desc":93,"surfaceType":506},{"title":733,"body":734,"divs":735,"images":749},"ISic001177.

damaged and was already very difficult to read when the first surviving transcription was made by Antonio Agustín in 1559-1560. The text of Agustín remains the closest to the best reconstruction which can now be made of the text, combining the conjectures and efforts of multiple scholars over the centuries (Prestianni Giallombardo 1993: tab.1 reproduces Agustín’s transcription, preserved in codex Matritensis 5781 f.22; see further Prestianni Giallombardo 2012: 175-176). The text records honours set up by a group of soldiers for their military commander, one Herakleios son of Diodoros. Both names are well attested in Sicily, including at Halaesa (see LGPN). The incomplete word which follows the name could be the beginning of a demotic-type abbreviation, which is commonly found in Halaesan inscriptions, although none beginning ΚΑ- are currently known; it could also be a second name in the Sicilian Greek tradition (cf. Cordano 1997 and 1999: 152-154). Both the men serving as soldiers (presumably citizens of Halaesa) and the commander, described as a chiliarch, are recorded as serving at Eryx (modern Erice), where there was a major sanctuary of Astarte / Aphrodite / Venus. Diodorus Siculus (4.83.7) records that the Roman senate decreed “that the 17 most loyal cities in Sicily should wear gold in Aphrodite’s honour and that 200 soldiers should watch over the sanctuary.” Diodorus does not date this decree, but it is most likely to belong to the period immediately after the First Punic War (Prag 2011: 195-197). Two other inscriptions found at Eryx (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001101\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001101\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000538\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000538\u003C/a>) also record soldiers and commanders at Eryx, and it is a reasonable assumption that all three inscriptions relate to this special garrison, and that this text records soldiers from Halaesa serving in the garrison. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001101\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001101\u003C/a> records a Segestan also holding the position of chiliarch; the fact that our text was set up in Halaesa, makes it very likely that Herakleios was a Halaesan holding the same position. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000538\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000538\u003C/a> describes the (unknown) commander of the same garrison as a tribunus militum and the Greek title chiliarch is the usual translation for this Roman position (it is interesting to see Greek citizens adopting a Roman military title). The presence of this text at Halaesa also implies that Halaesa was one of the 17 loyal cities mentioned by Diodorus and by Cicero (Verr.5.124), which fits with the city’s privileged status under Rome (see Pais 1888: 173-194 for the fullest discussion of this group, and Prag 2007b: 82-83 on the garrison).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The inscription finds a local parallel in \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000612\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000612\u003C/a>, in which citizens of Halaesa and several other communities honour a Roman commander; a further parallel from Halaesa is offered by an as yet unpublished text in which cavalrymen from several cities including Halaesa honour an unknown individual.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp> The text cannot be closely dated, but belongs in the period between 241 and 49 BC.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":664,"html":745},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0355\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 43.1208.2 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 41.0776 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus (no date) no.137, 141 \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 [1625] 47 no.300 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Muratori 1740 820 no.3 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001395\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001395\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1753 147-148 no.5 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002086\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002086\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1769 cl.9 no.15 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1784 cl.9 no.16 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 3.5598 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 5203 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000817\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000817\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 507 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001116\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001116\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 1987 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001663\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001663\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 1993 ph \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001659\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001659\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Nenci 1998 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001728\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001728\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Facella 2006 329-331 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Scibona 2008 27 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001594\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001594\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 2012 175 fig.152 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.7 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":747,"html":748},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
