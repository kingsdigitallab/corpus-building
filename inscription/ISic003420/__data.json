publication, based upon observation from a distance after the theatre re-opened to the public. His edition assumes at least one line is missing from before the preserved text, containing the name of an emperor, with DIV[---] being part of 'divi filio' or 'divi nepoti'. However, for reasons noted above, this seems less easy to sustain from observation of the stone, and a dedication to a deified emperor as Divus, seems more likely. This does little to limit the possibilities, since such dedications range from Augustus (together with Tiberius, to explain the presence of tribunicia potestate), through to various of the Antonine and Severan emperors. The form of the lettering perhaps favours an earlier rather than later date, perhaps either Julio-Claudian or Trajan/Hadrian, and the re-use of the stone means that it could originally have come from e.g. the forum, rather than the theatre.",{"type":421,"listBibl":422},"bibliography",[423,427],{"type":115,"bibl":424},{"author":118,"date":119,"citedRange":120,"ptr":425,"ref":426},{"target":122},{"_":124,"target":124},{"type":128,"bibl":109},[429,430,431,432],{"n":362,"url":96,"height":363,"width":364,"desc":97,"surfaceType":359},{"n":362,"url":369,"height":364,"width":363,"desc":97,"surfaceType":359},{"n":362,"url":373,"height":364,"width":363,"desc":97,"surfaceType":359},{"n":362,"url":380,"height":364,"width":363,"desc":97,"surfaceType":377},{"title":434,"body":435,"divs":436,"images":450},"ISic003420.
