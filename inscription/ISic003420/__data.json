However, for reasons noted above, this seems less easy to sustain from observation of the stone, and a dedication to a deified emperor as Divus, seems more likely. This does little to limit the possibilities, since such dedications range from Augustus (together with Tiberius, to explain the presence of tribunicia potestate), through to various of the Antonine and Severan emperors. The form of the lettering perhaps favours an earlier rather than later date, perhaps either Julio-Claudian or Trajan/Hadrian, and the re-use of the stone means that it could originally have come from e.g. the forum, rather than the theatre.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Korhonen 2004 241 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001897\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001897\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[438,441,443,445,447,449],{"id":439,"html":440},"editions","\u003Cdiv id=\"edition-interpretive\" lang=\"la\">  \u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div-interpretive\">  \u003Ca id=\"al1-interpretive\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>div[o \u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>] \u003Cbr id=\"al2-interpretive\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>tri[bunicia potestate \u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>] \u003C/span>\u003C/div>  \u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>\u003C/div>\u003Cdiv id=\"edition-diplomatic\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div-diplomatic\">\u003Ca id=\"al1-diplomatic\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>DIV[.\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al2-diplomatic\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>TRI[................\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>\u003C/div>",{"id":409,"html":442},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"1\">1: \u003Cspan>Korhonen: div(i) [--- filio (or nepoti, etc.)---]\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":417,"html":444},"\u003Ch2> translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":419,"html":446},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Korhonen offered the first publication, based upon observation from a distance after the theatre re-opened to the public.
