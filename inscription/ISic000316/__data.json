A manuscript in the Vatican library records a fourth, similar fragment seen in the Museo dei\n                    Benedettini by C. Stevenson in the 1880s. The text, which may be common to all these fragmentary\n                    inscriptions, can be restored as it has been here.","The texts are probably honorific inscriptions. Marble slabs of this sort are commonly attached to a\n                    statue base or similar monument. The base itself would be made out of a different, cheaper, local\n                    stone (e.g. volcanic stone), the more expensive imported marble reserved for the inscription. The\n                    existence of multiple texts, apparently for the same person, has two possible explanations: either\n                    the same honorific inscription was repeated on all four(?) sides of the statue base or other\n                    monument; or else there were multiple honorific statues or monuments in Catania for this one\n                    individual (both possibilities are attested elsewhere). The remainder of the inscription will have\n                    included details of the rest of his career (compare the inscriptions for Quintus Atilius Severus\n                    (also of the Claudian tribe) and Lucius Rubrius Proculus).
