The existence of multiple texts, apparently for the same person, has two possible explanations: either the same honorific inscription was repeated on all four(?) sides of the statue base or other monument; or else there were multiple honorific statues or monuments in Catania for this one individual (both possibilities are attested elsewhere). The remainder of the inscription will have included details of the rest of his career (compare the inscriptions for Quintus Atilius Severus (also of the Claudian tribe) and Lucius Rubrius Proculus). Lucius Caelius Macer is one of five duumviri known from Roman Catania.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/books/CILv10pII1883\" target=\"_blank\">10.7032\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 19 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[472,474,476,478,480,482,484],{"id":105,"html":473},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"underline\">LCAELIUSLF\u003C/span>\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>C.\u003Cspan class=\"underline\">A\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"underline\">MACER\u003C/span>\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"supraline\" title=\"line above\">II\u003C/span>V[..\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al4\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">4\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":433,"html":475},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line1\">Line1: \u003Cspan>Text restored on the parallel of ISic000337\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line2\">Line2: \u003Cspan>Text restored on the parallel of ISic000337\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":442,"html":477},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Lucius Caelius Macer, son of Lucius, of the Claudian tribe, duumvir... .\u003C/p>  ",{"id":442,"html":479},"\u003Ch2>Italian translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Lucio Celio Macro, figlio di Lucio, della tribù Claudia, duumviro... .\u003C/p>  ",{"id":448,"html":481},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Although none of the texts of ISic000337, 0315 or 0316 join together, and all show minor differences in form or material (e.g. compare the moulding on each), the text presented on each appears to be the same.
