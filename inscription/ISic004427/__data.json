Nonetheless the presence of variations on the formulation of E̅K̅L̅ KAT which is found also in those texts, and the broadly similar geographical area of origin, strongly suggest that this stone has a similar context, namely as a boundary stone relating to the lands of the early church in Sicily. Like Pace before him, Ferrua interpreted these in this way, and expands this text speculatively as: ek(k)l(esiae) Kat(inensis) n(o)va(le). This text, together with ISic004425 and ISic004426, is only reported by Gaetano Marini, and the texts in Angelo Mai, Pace, and Ferrua all derive directly from this one record. Pace understood Marini to refer to four sides of a single stone, but Ferrua more reasonably interprets the annotations of Marini to refer firstly to two sides of one stone (ISic004425: 'hinc', 'inde'); and then to two further separate texts (ISic004426: 'item altera reperta in agro'(?)) and in this case: 'item altera inscripta'. It is not impossible that this text and ISic004426 are in fact the same as the two recorded by Gualtherus (ISic001338 and ISicc4424), but the differences, especially in this case, are sufficient to suggest not.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The date of the stone is very difficult to ascertain.
