There may be a trace of an interpunct surviving just before the vertical hasta of the second letter, although the space is limited; this would encourage a reading of Q · F ·, i.e. Q(uinti) f(ilius), suggesting that line three carries another personal name in the nominative, and so a second dedicant responsible for the text (e.g. a fellow magistrate or priest). Alternatively, if we read OE at the end of a word, this is most likely a female name such as Callirhoe or Zoe (and so perhaps the wife, mother, or daughter of Paccius).

In any case, the presence of divi Augusti provides a terminus post quem of AD 14. A dedication to Tiberius is known from nearby Capo d’Orlando, ancient Agathyrnum (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003339\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003339\u003C/a>). Paccius is a common Latin name of Oscan derivation. The name is rarely attested in Sicily: an individual of Oscan origin at Entella in the third century BC (Entella tablets \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/699040\" target=\"_blank\">C1\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/699041\" target=\"_blank\">C2\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/699042\" target=\"_blank\">C3\u003C/a>); but more improtantly on the municipal coinage of Halaesa itself, where one Marcus Paccius Maximus is recorded as both duovir and flamen Augusti (designatus) (RPC I, nos. 630-633, of Augustan date, e.g. \u003Ca href=\"http://numismatics.org/collection/2015.20.550\" target=\"_blank\">ANS 2015.20.550\u003C/a>). Paccius son of Marcus in line 2 of this inscription could refer either to the same individual as that on the coinage, or a relative (such as his son). A dedication to Tiberius by either M. Paccius Maximus himself, or e.g. his son would be entirely plausible (see Facella 2006: 208-210 and 273-74 for M. Paccius Maximus, in the context of extensive Campanian connections to Halaesa).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>In line 3, traces of two letters and at least one interpunct survive. The first letter is either Q or O (D is unlikely from the traces on the stone); the second letter is either E or F. There may be a trace of an interpunct surviving just before the vertical hasta of the second letter, although the space is limited; this would encourage a reading of Q · F ·, i.e. Q(uinti) f(ilius), suggesting that line three carries another personal name in the nominative, and so a second dedicant responsible for the text (e.g. a fellow magistrate or priest). Alternatively, if we read OE at the end of a word, this is most likely a female name such as Callirhoe or Zoe (and so perhaps the wife, mother, or daughter of Paccius).
