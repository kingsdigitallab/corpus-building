Both this and ISic020917 record women with Oscan nomenclature, albeit written in Greek. This example preserves the Oscan style of nomenclature (praenomen and gentilicium), but transformed with Greek genitive endings and age at death in the distinctively Sicilian ascending numerals, attested in various inscriptions of the Hellenistic period across the island. Arena suggests that the form Pakua derives form the Oscan Pakviú, and that the transposition to Πακυία and in turn the elision of the υι to υ is influenced by the Doric of the region.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The text was first partially published, at second hand, by Tagliamonte, from an incomplete report from the excavator G.
