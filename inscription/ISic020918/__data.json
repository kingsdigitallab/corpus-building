The tomb itself, with 3 stone couches, appears to have been constructed for wealthy inhumation burials in the fourth or early third century BCE. It appears that the tomb was re-used in the third century for multiple cremation burials, before subsequently suffering a collapse; a later burial (1st century BCE) in the dromos suggests a terminus ante quem for the period of re-use. Only one of the other cinerary containers preserves a text on it (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020917\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020917\u003C/a>), incised on a different and probably slightly earlier type of vessel; but most of the vessels are so fragmentary that it is difficult to read much significance into this. Both this and ISic020917 record women with Oscan nomenclature, albeit written in Greek. This example preserves the Oscan style of nomenclature (praenomen and gentilicium), but transformed with Greek genitive endings and age at death in the distinctively Sicilian ascending numerals, attested in various inscriptions of the Hellenistic period across the island. Arena suggests that the form Pakua derives form the Oscan Pakviú, and that the transposition to Πακυία and in turn the elision of the υι to υ is influenced by the Doric of the region.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The text was first partially published, at second hand, by Tagliamonte, from an incomplete report from the excavator G.
