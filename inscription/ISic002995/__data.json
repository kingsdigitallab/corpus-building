Eponymous officials without an explicit title are relatively common in Sicily, and the traces on the stone suggest a signfiicant gap, so that there is no necessary need to restore anything further after the word (see Manganaro 1961, p. 129 n. 13 for discussion of the title ἄρχοντες, and the surveys of Sicilian eponymous officials in R. Sherk, The eponymous officials of Greek cities V: the register, in ZPE, 96, 1993, pp. 267 295 and P. Di Veroli, Nuovi eponimi della Sicilia ellenistica, in ZPE , 110, 1996, pp. 309 310).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>It is impossible to know whether the stone was a statue base or an altar (parallels for both altars (uninscribed) and small bases with similar texts can be found at Akrai, e.g. Bernabó Brea, Akrai (1956), p. 139-140; \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001031\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001031\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001029\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001029\u003C/a> and esp. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001024\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001024\u003C/a>). In either case, this is likely to have been a dedication to a divinity by the college of hierothytai and Manganaro (1961, p. 128 n. 9) suggested that it was an altar dedicated to the local divinity Adranos. This must remain speculation, however attractive. It is likely that the name of the deity to which it was dedicated appeared at the top of the inscription, perhaps on the, now lost, upper moulding of the stone.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":585,"html":702},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 58.1038 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 1962.0394 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001282\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001282\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 107 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000160\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000160\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi 1900 42 no.1 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001707\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001707\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Russo 1911 85 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001615\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001615\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Libertini 1932 12 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001869\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001869\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Soraci 1958 255-256 ph \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001571\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001571\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1961 126-130 fig.1 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001447\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001447\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Winand 1990 130-131 no.3 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001506\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001506\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi and Pelagatti 1967-1968 141 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001695\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001695\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Albanese 1991 546 no.1 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002196\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002196\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag 2015 323-325 no. 1 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002338\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002338\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":704,"html":705},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
