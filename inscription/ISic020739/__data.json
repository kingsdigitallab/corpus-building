To the first group, the drinking vessels, belong 7 vases, of which 3 belong to the deceased in the front of the chamber, 4 to the second, in the back. The inscriptions of this first group show what appear to be names, perhaps onomastic formulae, followed by an ending -mi that could be (cf. Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, p. 195) an aphaeretic form of the verb εἰμί, not known in Greek epigraphic culture but perhaps adapted by the writers of Montagna di Marzo in correspondence with syntactic structures proper to their language. This epigraphic formula could be comparable to the Greek ownership inscriptions. In this document we have 'ares kaka' as the onomastic formula, without -mi (but other two vessels from the same grave feature the same onomastic formula 'ares kaka' with the ending -mi, see \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020740\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020740\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020741\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020741\u003C/a>).

The burials were contained in two clay sarcophagi. The vessels found in the tomb can be divided into two groups (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, 194): large Attic (imported) drinking vessels (cups, 'stemless cups', a skyphos, i.e. luxury vessels, typically related to the consumption of wine in the symposium); vessels of different types, all of a smaller size. To the first group, the drinking vessels, belong 7 vases, of which 3 belong to the deceased in the front of the chamber, 4 to the second, in the back. The inscriptions of this first group show what appear to be names, perhaps onomastic formulae, followed by an ending -mi that could be (cf. Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, p. 195) an aphaeretic form of the verb εἰμί, not known in Greek epigraphic culture but perhaps adapted by the writers of Montagna di Marzo in correspondence with syntactic structures proper to their language. This epigraphic formula could be comparable to the Greek ownership inscriptions. In this document we have 'ares kaka' as the onomastic formula, without -mi (but other two vessels from the same grave feature the same onomastic formula 'ares kaka' with the ending -mi, see \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020740\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020740\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020741\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020741\u003C/a>).
