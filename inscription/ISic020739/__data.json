This epigraphic formula could be comparable to the Greek ownership inscriptions.

To the first group, the drinking vessels, belong 7 vases, of which 3 belong to the deceased in the front of the chamber, 4 to the second, in the back. The inscriptions of this first group show what appear to be names, perhaps onomastic formulae, followed by an ending -mi that could be (cf. Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, p. 195) an aphaeretic form of the verb εἰμί, not known in Greek epigraphic culture but perhaps adapted by the writers of Montagna di Marzo in correspondence with syntactic structures proper to their language. This epigraphic formula could be comparable to the Greek ownership inscriptions. In this document we have 'ares kaka' as the onomastic formula, without -mi (but other two vessels from the same grave feature the same onomastic formula 'ares kaka' with the ending -mi, see \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020740\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020740\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020741\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020741\u003C/a>). The name inscribed is probably that of one of the two deceased in the grave.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":345,"html":404},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani Forthcoming MMA?? \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Mussinano 1970 no. 2, p. 171, pl.
