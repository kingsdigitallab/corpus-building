certain that the first part of lines 2, 3, and 5 was engraved on a second stone (and so the text would have appeared symmetrical to the viewer). Burgio (2012) has demonstrated convincingly that this stone comes from the right side of an exedra monument on the steps of the west portico (exedra A), and that two additional stones stood to the left (meaning that there was space to the left not only for the beginning of this text but also for a second similar inscription in honour of another individual). The name at the start of line 3 is lost, but must have been relatively short (symmetry suggests not more than c.6 letters). Scibona suggested Dion, known from Cicero (In Verrem 2.2.19-24) and from brick stamps found at Halaesa. Cicero records one Apollodorus Lapiron, but the Dio of Halaesa to whom he refers in the same passage is only a relative (propinquus), not his son (see Facella 2006: 229-241). The abbreviation Sal at the end of line three is probably a demotic (i.e. an indicator of the part of Halaesa to which this individual belonged): the abbreviation is also attested in the bronze for Nemenios (SEG 59.1100 line 9) and elsewhere in Sicily (e.g. at Akrai, ; see in general Cordano, F. 1999.
