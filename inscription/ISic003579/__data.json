Exempla Scripturae Epigraphicae Latinae a Caesaris Dictatoris Morte ad Aetatem Iustiniani. Berlin, at p.LXXI) offers examples, and these examples suggest that the central hasta of the number extended above the line. It is likely that the inscription continued on at least one other comparable panel, perhaps to the left, because we would expect the individual recording his (or her) generosity) to be named.
