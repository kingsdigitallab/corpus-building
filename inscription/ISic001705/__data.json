His is the only report, and he presents it explicitly as a second text in addition to that previously recorded by Gualtherus (ISic000582), and describes it in different terms, suggesting that it is a monumental text in marble (but whether intact or not is uncertain). Mommsen noted it in his apparatus to CIL 10.7458 (ISic000582) and implied some scepticism ('venit sin dubio ex narrationibus eorum qui lapidem videssent memoriter traditis'). It was also noted by Prestianni Giallombardo (but omitted from Prag and Tigano 2017). As Ampolo and Erdas note (2019, p.112), the more recent discovery of a statue base reading simply 'municipium' at Segesta (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000666\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000666\u003C/a>) should encourage some credibility in Torremuzza's report. It remains unclear if this is e.g. a statue base or part of a building.
