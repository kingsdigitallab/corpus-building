This link has been accepted by subsequent scholars. However, there has been considerable confusion and uncertainty regarding this stone in other regards. Manganaro described the piece as being made of 'pietra lavica', and suggested that it was an honorific statue base. According to Manganaro the piece was still in the theatre when he published it in 1961. Subsequent scholars (Wilson, Pensabene) have reported a limestone piece which is in the stores of the Museo Civico di Catania (noted as unpublished), and have consistently distinguished the two pieces (beginning with Wilson 1988: 127 n.128; followed by Wilson 1990: 69 and 365 n.118; Wilson 1996: 161 n.35; Pensabene 1996-1997: 71 n.181). Korhonen repeats this report, while also noting the existence of a 'copia in gesso' (2004: 174 n.86) in the Museo Civico. Both a resin cast/squeeze of the face of the inscription, and a plaster cast copy presumably made using this cast/squeeze are preserved in the Museo Civico (both seen in storage in 2017). The plaster cast (heavily discoloured, and giving the appearance of weathered limestone), originally on display in the 1970s, at height, on the walls of the Museo Civico, is undoubtedly the source of the original belief that there was a second 'limestone' version of the original inscription, and it is safe to conclude that there was in fact only a single such text in antiquity, in volcanic stone. The original, which is indeed of the typical black volcanic stone of the city, is currently (2024) lying with the confines of the archaeological park of the Roman theatre, in a collection of large stone elements behind the adjoining Roman odeon. The clamp holes at the top, and the shape of the stone, make its function as architrave or door lintel more likely than as an honorific statue base.",{"_":453,"target":454},"ISic000352","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000352",{"type":456,"listBibl":457},"bibliography",[458,478],{"type":106,"bibl":459},[460,463,466,469,472,475],{"author":109,"date":110,"citedRange":111,"ptr":461,"ref":462},{"target":113},{"_":115,"target":115},{"author":117,"date":118,"citedRange":119,"ptr":464,"ref":465},{"target":121},{"_":123,"target":123},{"author":117,"date":125,"citedRange":126,"ptr":467,"ref":468},{"target":128},{"_":130,"target":130},{"author":117,"date":132,"citedRange":133,"ptr":470,"ref":471},{"target":135},{"_":137,"target":137},{"author":139,"date":140,"citedRange":141,"ptr":473,"ref":474},{"target":143},{"_":145,"target":145},{"author":147,"date":148,"citedRange":149,"ptr":476,"ref":477},{"target":151},{"_":153,"target":153},{"type":155,"bibl":30},[480,481,482,483,484],{"n":389,"url":91,"height":390,"width":391,"desc":92,"surfaceType":386},{"n":389,"url":396,"height":390,"width":391,"desc":92,"surfaceType":386},{"n":389,"url":400,"height":401,"width":402,"desc":403,"surfaceType":386},{"n":389,"url":410,"height":390,"width":391,"desc":92,"surfaceType":407},{"n":389,"url":417,"height":390,"width":391,"desc":92,"surfaceType":414},{"title":486,"body":487,"divs":488,"images":502},"ISic003005.

Both a resin cast/squeeze of the face of the inscription, and a plaster cast copy presumably made using this cast/squeeze are preserved in the Museo Civico (both seen in storage in 2017). The plaster cast (heavily discoloured, and giving the appearance of weathered limestone), originally on display in the 1970s, at height, on the walls of the Museo Civico, is undoubtedly the source of the original belief that there was a second 'limestone' version of the original inscription, and it is safe to conclude that there is in fact only a single such text, in volcanic stone. The original, which is indeed of the typical black volcanic stone of the city, is currently (2021) lying with the confines of the archaeological park of the Roman theatre, in a collection of large stone elements behind the adjoining Roman odeon.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>NB The photograph displayed here is of the plaster cast, not of the original.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1961 195-196 and fig.20 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001852\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001852\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 1988 127 n.128 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001430\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001430\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 1990 69 and 365 n.118 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001509\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001509\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 1996 161 n.35 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001507\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001507\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Pensabene 1996-1997 71 n.181 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001675\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001675\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Korhonen 2004 174 n.86 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence \u003C/div>",[489,491,493,495,497,499],{"id":106,"html":490},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>TFLAVIOIONIO[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":441,"html":492},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from photo\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":446,"html":494},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>To Titus Flavius Ionius\u003C/p>  ",{"id":449,"html":496},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The stone was published by Manganaro in 1961, who suggested that it commemorated the same individual as \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000352\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000352\u003C/a>, a funerary altar for Titus Fla[vius] Ion[ius]. This link has been accepted by subsequent scholars. However, there has been considerable confusion and uncertainty regarding this stone in other regards. Manganaro described the piece as being made of 'pietra lavica', and suggested that it was an honorific statue base. According to Manganaro the piece was still in the theatre when he published it in 1961. Subsequent scholars (Wilson, Pensabene) have reported a limestone piece which is in the stores of the Museo Civico di Catania (noted as unpublished), and have consistently distinguished the two pieces (beginning with Wilson 1988: 127 n.128; followed by Wilson 1990: 69 and 365 n.118; Wilson 1996: 161 n.35; Pensabene 1996-1997: 71 n.181). Korhonen repeats this report, while also noting the existence of a 'copia in gesso' (2004: 174 n.86) in the Museo Civico. Both a resin cast/squeeze of the face of the inscription, and a plaster cast copy presumably made using this cast/squeeze are preserved in the Museo Civico (both seen in storage in 2017). The plaster cast (heavily discoloured, and giving the appearance of weathered limestone), originally on display in the 1970s, at height, on the walls of the Museo Civico, is undoubtedly the source of the original belief that there was a second 'limestone' version of the original inscription, and it is safe to conclude that there is in fact only a single such text, in volcanic stone.
