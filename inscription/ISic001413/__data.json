inscription and its partner () remains that by Tusa (1963), which was never picked up in SEG and Tusa's text has simply been reproduced in subsequent discussions and presentations (e.g. Dimartino or in EDR). The text is however far from perfectly preserved, and Tusa's reading, particularly of the first two lines of this text, should not go unchallenged. Most fundamentally, Tusa's reading of the patronym Ἀπ[ολλωνίου] in line 1 cannot stand: I read Ἀρίστ[ωνος] (the traces of the first five letters are reasonably secure), and this would therefore mean that the eponymous priest in this text is the same man as in the adjacent text, ISic001414 and confirm the general assumption that this is a contemporary double dedication. However, it requires that the family relationships identified by Tusa in his original publication be reconsidered. It should additionally be noted that almost nothing can be read of the patronym in line two (i.e. of the dedicant of this text). However, the length of the lacuna in line 2 corresponds very closely to the length of the name Ἀπολλώνιον in line 3 (plus the missing letter from the end of Ἀρίστω[ν]), such that Tusa's proposed restoration (notwithstanding the typographic error of ν for υ in the original publication) of this patronym should be allowed to stand. Consequently, applying Occam's razor, to keep the number of individuals to a minimum, it would appear that (a) the eponymous hierothytes (Philon, son of Ariston) is identical in line 1 of both this text and ISic001414; (b) this text is dedicated by the father of the eponym (Ariston, son of Apollonios), who in turn appears as the honorand and amphipolos in ISic001414; (c) the honorand and amphipolos in this text is therefore the grandfather of the eponymous priest Philon; (d) in ISic001414 it is the eponymous priest Philon and his two brothers who honour their father, Apollonios (the dedicant in this text). Although this does entail that three generations appear to be active simultaneously (although it is perhaps not strictly necessary that the grandfather, honoured in this text, had held the position of amphipolos particularly recently, only that the father, honoured in ISic001414 had done so?), it appears the most logical resolution of the relationships described, and implies a strong grip on the local honours over several generations by one family, not dissimilar to the position of the family of Antallos which appears in several other Soluntum inscriptions of the same period (e.g. ).",[617,619],{"_":25,"target":618},"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001414",{"_":620,"target":621},"ISic001130","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001130","The chronology has been much debated, but the inscription itself can hardly serve to resolve debates about the date of the monumentalisation of the agora or the city more broadly, and any date for the inscription should almost certainly be subordinated to the archaeological dating of the structures - for which the current consensus leans to the second century BCE (Wolf) or more specifically the later second century (Portale).

Although this does entail that three generations appear to be active simultaneously (although it is perhaps not strictly necessary that the grandfather, honoured in this text, had held the position of amphipolos particularly recently, only that the father, honoured in ISic001414 had done so?), it appears the most logical resolution of the relationships described, and implies a strong grip on the local honours over several generations by one family, not dissimilar to the position of the family of Antallos which appears in several other Soluntum inscriptions of the same period (e.g. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001130\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001130\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The chronology has been much debated, but the inscription itself can hardly serve to resolve debates about the date of the monumentalisation of the agora or the city more broadly, and any date for the inscription should almost certainly be subordinated to the archaeological dating of the structures - for which the current consensus leans to the second century BCE (Wolf) or more specifically the later second century (Portale). The form of the inscription, including adscript iota, would perhaps suggest a date no later than the second century BCE, but given the coarse nature of the stone, and the strong likelihood that the stone was finished with a layer of plaster and paint, the simple nature of the letter forms (especially the lack of serifs) is not particularly instructive and can only point to a later Hellenistic date.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 46.1242c1 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Tusa 1963 186 no.1 tav.

The text is however far from perfectly preserved, and Tusa's reading, particularly of the first two lines of this text, should not go unchallenged. Most fundamentally, Tusa's reading of the patronym Ἀπ[ολλωνίου] in line 1 cannot stand: I read Ἀρίστ[ωνος] (the traces of the first five letters are reasonably secure), and this would therefore mean that the eponymous priest in this text is the same man as in the adjacent text, ISic001414 and confirm the general assumption that this is a contemporary double dedication. However, it requires that the family relationships identified by Tusa in his original publication be reconsidered. It should additionally be noted that almost nothing can be read of the patronym in line two (i.e. of the dedicant of this text). However, the length of the lacuna in line 2 corresponds very closely to the length of the name Ἀπολλώνιον in line 3 (plus the missing letter from the end of Ἀρίστω[ν]), such that Tusa's proposed restoration (notwithstanding the typographic error of ν for υ in the original publication) of this patronym should be allowed to stand. Consequently, applying Occam's razor, to keep the number of individuals to a minimum, it would appear that (a) the eponymous hierothytes (Philon, son of Ariston) is identical in line 1 of both this text and ISic001414; (b) this text is dedicated by the father of the eponym (Ariston, son of Apollonios), who in turn appears as the honorand and amphipolos in ISic001414; (c) the honorand and amphipolos in this text is therefore the grandfather of the eponymous priest Philon; (d) in ISic001414 it is the eponymous priest Philon and his two brothers who honour their father, Apollonios (the dedicant in this text). Although this does entail that three generations appear to be active simultaneously (although it is perhaps not strictly necessary that the grandfather, honoured in this text, had held the position of amphipolos particularly recently, only that the father, honoured in ISic001414 had done so?), it appears the most logical resolution of the relationships described, and implies a strong grip on the local honours over several generations by one family, not dissimilar to the position of the family of Antallos which appears in several other Soluntum inscriptions of the same period (e.g. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001130\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001130\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The chronology has been much debated, but the inscription itself can hardly serve to resolve debates about the date of the monumentalisation of the agora or the city more broadly, and any date for the inscription should almost certainly be subordinated to the archaeological dating of the structures - for which the current consensus leans to the second century BCE (Wolf) or more specifically the later second century (Portale).
