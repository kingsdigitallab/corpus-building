If the -(a)emi ending corresponds to what we see with μαρεσκακαμι/αρaκακαμι, then this particular correction could be a sign of a gradual shift to the more regular -εμι in relation to the Greek verb, and this could (together with data from the archaeological context that for now remains elusive) speak in favour of a later date for this inscription than the ones in the tomb East 31. The name could perhaps have ended in -a and hence the confusion over the vowel of the final part of it when merged with the verb εἰμί.

This would again (see ISic020745) speak in favour of the probable use of the two alphas in a complementary manner in the Sikel alphabet of Montagna di Marzo (and elsewhere): the first alpha, the arrow-shaped one, is part of the original root of the indigenous name, the second is instead part of the desinence of the name in contact with the verb εἰμί. Were both replaced with epsilon by mistake? Or perhaps a gradual change occurs in the indigenous vowel system due to the influence of the Greek language? There is no certain answer to this phenomenon, but it is certain that the corrections and the numerous paloegraphic and vocalic 'variants' that the corpus from Montagna di Marzo presents must be studied as a single system, with particular attention to diachrony (when the archaeological context allows it) and looking not only at the phenomena that characterise the letter alpha but also at those related to the evident changes in the ductus of other 'distinctive' letters, such as rho, upsilon and sigma.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani Forthcoming MMA 66 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018 185, fig. 98, 195 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001345\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001345\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[43,46,48,51,54,56,59,62],{"id":44,"html":45},"edition","  \u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"scx\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\">  \u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>δ«ε»δεν«ε»μι \u003C/span>\u003C/div>  ",{"id":44,"html":47},"  \u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"scx-Latn\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\">  \u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>d«e»den«e»mi \u003C/span>\u003C/div>  ",{"id":49,"html":50},"apparatus","\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cp>  \u003Cspan class=\"\">  \u003Cspan>Text after Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018.\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>  \u003C/p>",{"id":52,"html":53},"translation","\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":52,"html":55},"\u003Ch2>Italian translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":57,"html":58},"commentary","\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The inscription was found in grave 188, where two other inscriptions were discovered on two different bowls (MMA 64-65, ISic020757-ISic020758).
