fragments that this is an honorific for the emperor C. Messius Q. Traianus Decius (reigned c. September 249 to c. June 251 AD) and restoration of the text can be attempted on that basis (for Decius’ titles, see Wittig, K. 1932. RE 15, s.v. Messius no.9, col.1244-1286; Babcock, C. 1962. An inscription of Trajan Decius from Cosa. AJP 83: 147-158; and Peachin, M. 1990. Roman Imperial Titulature and Chronology, A.D. 235-284. Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben, at 32-34). Several considerations constrain the expansion. The first half of the second surviving line can only, realistically, contain the dative of the name Quintus. This serves more or less to define the width of the text and imposes limits on possible restorations. Given the space at the end of the first preserved line, which implies a corresponding indentation at the start of the line, it would be difficult to restore [IMP·CAES·C·M]ESSIO. This might be solved by restoring only IMP(erator), but the use of IMP(erator) alone is very unusual. An alternative solution is offered by the presence of a guideline above that of the first surviving line, which implies the presence of an additional line of text at the top of the inscription, which could be any of IMP, IMP·D·N·, or IMP·CAES· (although even IMP·CAES· looks over long, given the vacat at the top of what survives). Any such solution entails that the next line be restored as [CAIO · M]ESSIO ·, which is plausible given that Quintus is clearly spelled out in full. The following line is unproblematic, with Decius readily filling the available space. The precise expansion of the fourth surviving line depends upon the extent to which the text was centred, with space at start and end, and how far the name of the city was abbreviated. The alternative extremes are perhaps [(v.)AVG · ]ṚES P̣ ḤẠḶ[(v.)] and [AVG ·P·M· ]ṚES P̣ ḤẠḶ[AES], and the former is perhaps preferable. The surviving letters of the last two preserved lines are readily compatible with the formula \"devota numini maiestatique eius\", found in a number of honorifics for Traianus Decius, such as  and , although considerations of space affect the precise layout on the stone. A further formulation at the end, such as D(ecreto) D(ecurionum) is possible (as in ), but not necessary.",[431,434,437],{"_":432,"target":433},"AE 2002 no.465","https://www.trismegistos.org/text/248065",{"_":435,"target":436},"AE 1942/43 no.113","https://www.trismegistos.org/text/204563",{"_":438,"target":439},"ISic003590","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003590",{"_":441,"ref":442},"The formula res publica is found in a number of Sicilian cities in the period from the later C2 AD to the early C4 AD, such as at Palermo/Panhormus (, , , , , , , , all imperial honorifics, late C2 AD to early C4 AD); at Solunto/Soluntum (, Fulvia Plautilla, 202-205 AD), at Termini/Thermae (, perhaps C2 AD), Tyndaris (, 198-211 AD), and Marsala/Lilybaeum (, C1 AD).

Messius Q. Traianus Decius (reigned c. September 249 to c. June 251 AD) and restoration of the text can be attempted on that basis (for Decius’ titles, see Wittig, K. 1932. RE 15, s.v. Messius no.9, col.1244-1286; Babcock, C. 1962. An inscription of Trajan Decius from Cosa. AJP 83: 147-158; and Peachin, M. 1990. Roman Imperial Titulature and Chronology, A.D. 235-284. Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben, at 32-34). Several considerations constrain the expansion. The first half of the second surviving line can only, realistically, contain the dative of the name Quintus. This serves more or less to define the width of the text and imposes limits on possible restorations. Given the space at the end of the first preserved line, which implies a corresponding indentation at the start of the line, it would be difficult to restore [IMP·CAES·C·M]ESSIO. This might be solved by restoring only IMP(erator), but the use of IMP(erator) alone is very unusual. An alternative solution is offered by the presence of a guideline above that of the first surviving line, which implies the presence of an additional line of text at the top of the inscription, which could be any of IMP, IMP·D·N·, or IMP·CAES· (although even IMP·CAES· looks over long, given the vacat at the top of what survives). Any such solution entails that the next line be restored as [CAIO · M]ESSIO ·, which is plausible given that Quintus is clearly spelled out in full. The following line is unproblematic, with Decius readily filling the available space. The precise expansion of the fourth surviving line depends upon the extent to which the text was centred, with space at start and end, and how far the name of the city was abbreviated. The alternative extremes are perhaps [(v.)AVG · ]ṚES P̣ ḤẠḶ[(v.)] and [AVG ·P·M· ]ṚES P̣ ḤẠḶ[AES], and the former is perhaps preferable. The surviving letters of the last two preserved lines are readily compatible with the formula \"devota numini maiestatique eius\", found in a number of honorifics for Traianus Decius, such as \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/248065\" target=\"_blank\">AE 2002 no.465\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/204563\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1942/43 no.113\u003C/a>, although considerations of space affect the precise layout on the stone.
