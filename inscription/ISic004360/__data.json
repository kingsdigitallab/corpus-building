On that basis, the word in line 1 is perhaps most likely to be 'memoria' or 'gloria', and line 3 may contain reference to the individual responsible. The text does not appear to have been republished or discussed since Orsi. Orsi recorded it in the first of his taccuini, prior to publishing it in the NSA. Curiously, in neither case did he note the presence of a text on the reverse, which fact is recorded in the inventory (it is possible that the text was already fixed to the wall for display when he saw it?).\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Orsi NSA 1889 386 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Orsi 2018 Tacc. 1, p.46 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002617\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002617\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence \u003C/div>",[467,469,471,473,475,477],{"id":110,"html":468},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]RIAM\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">Â·Â·Â·\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>.....].OREMFACI[..\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]USUIS\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">Â·\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":427,"html":470},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"line 1\">line.1: \u003Cspan>Orsi (NSA): Riam. . . .; Orsi (Taccuini): RIAMIR .
