As Brugnone notes, it is possible that the missing name at the beginning of line 1 of column 1, and the missing name at the beginning of the lower band of text, is Aristodamos, attested in the inscription as the father of Nemenidas. The missing word at the end of column 1 is an unrecoverable superlative, Brugnone suggests several possibilities: ἀπλούστατος, εὐσεβέστατος, εὐτυχέστατος, σωφρονέστατος. Given the difference in text in the bottom band, these lines were perhaps added later. These lines are written in metrical form, with the description of Cleopatra as divine in line 1 of the bottom band in iambic trimeter, and the following two lines in hexameter. Brugnone notes that these poetic lines are very similar to the phrase \"sit tibi terra levis\" common in Latin funerary epigraphy, but that it can also be found in Greek contexts as well. It is possible that Nemenidas and Cleopatra are the parents of the poet, Aristodamos Nemenidas Persios, honoured in  also at Thermae Himeraeae. Brugnone even posits the hypothesis that this Aristodamos may have even written the verse inscribed on this plaque. Aristodamos is a name attested elsewhere in Sicily. The name Cleopatra, very frequently attested, is unsurprisingly linked to Hellenistic Egypt, but also has one other attestation in Thermae Himeraeae ",[537,540],{"_":538,"target":539},"ISic001135","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001135",{"_":541,"target":542},"ISic000100","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000100",{"type":544,"listBibl":545},"bibliography",[546,556],{"type":137,"bibl":547},[548,553,32],{"type":140,"n":141,"citedRange":549,"ptr":551,"ref":552},{"ref":550},{"_":144,"target":145},{"target":147},{"_":149,"target":149},{"type":140,"n":153,"citedRange":154,"ptr":554,"ref":555},{"target":156},{"_":158,"target":158},{"type":162,"bibl":32},[558],{"n":422,"url":113,"height":423,"width":424,"desc":114,"surfaceType":419},{"title":560,"body":561,"divs":562,"images":576},"ISic001148.
