Only a single serif is visible upper right for the final letter, but such a downward sloping serif, vertically overlapping with the right hasta of the A preceding, cannot realistically belong to anything other than the left end of the cross bar of a letter T. Pat[---] could be part of patronus, pater, or patria all of which are plausible in the context of a monumental (building) inscription.

The type of stone is very similar and the letters are of almost identical height and broadly similar form. However, the form and depth of the upper terminations of the letters M and A, the overall depth of the letters, the presence of red paint, and the differing profile of the stone (slightly taller, and thicker in its lower half) all challenge a direct association, even if the broad context and epigraphic type looks very similar.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The text is likely to belong to the first or second century AD.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":431,"html":454},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.10 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":456,"html":457},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
