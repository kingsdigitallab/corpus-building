These restorations in turn suggest a maximum width of 17 letters in line 1, and approximately 14-16 in lines 2 and 3. In line 2 this means up to 10 letters are lost, containing the nomen of Marcus, and in line 3 up to 5 letters, containing his cognomen, or just possibly tribus (the trace of a vertical stroke is visible after the final nu, compatible with either I or K). The nomen in line 2 has previously been restored as Αἰμίλιον, but the traces on the stone are incompatible with this: the first visible letter, which is either the third or the fourth of the name, could be be Α or Λ, but it cannot be Μ; the second appears to be either Μ or Ν, but not Ι. Both Flaminius and Caninius are possible (both attested on the island in the Republican period), but the possibilities are multiple, and no identification is possible. Although Marcus is clearly a Roman citizen (and at least a second generation Roman, since he is son of Publius), he is probably not being honoured for actions as a Roman official, since there is no room in this text for the title which this would require (the closest parallel therefore is  for Marcus Aemilius Rho[--], a first generation Roman citizen, rather than  for C. Vergilius Balbus, a proquaestor).",[531,534],{"_":532,"target":533},"ISic000770","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000770",{"_":535,"target":536},"ISic001178","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001178",{"type":538,"listBibl":539},"bibliography",[540,558],{"type":110,"bibl":541},[542,545,548,551,554,557],{"type":113,"n":114,"citedRange":115,"ptr":543,"ref":544},{"target":117},{"_":119,"target":119},{"author":121,"date":122,"ptr":546,"ref":547},{"target":124},{"_":126,"target":126},{"author":128,"date":129,"citedRange":130,"ptr":549,"ref":550},{"target":132},{"_":134,"target":134},{"author":136,"date":129,"citedRange":137,"ptr":552,"ref":553},{"target":139},{"_":141,"target":141},{"author":143,"date":144,"citedRange":145,"ptr":555,"ref":556},{"target":147},{"_":149,"target":149},{"author":151,"date":152},{"type":154,"bibl":30},[560,561],{"n":388,"url":95,"height":389,"width":390,"desc":96,"surfaceType":385},{"n":388,"url":395,"height":396,"width":397,"desc":398,"surfaceType":385},{"title":563,"body":564,"divs":565,"images":581},"ISic003351.

The nomen in line 2 has previously been restored as Αἰμίλιον, but the traces on the stone are incompatible with this: the first visible letter, which is either the third or the fourth of the name, could be be Α or Λ, but it cannot be Μ; the second appears to be either Μ or Ν, but not Ι.
