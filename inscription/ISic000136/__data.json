For the rarely attested name Audius, Bivona draws attention to two testimonies. The first is Audius Bassus, the proconsul of Cyprus in 198 CE, who is rembered in a bilingual inscription (CIL III.218). The second is ILS 9417 in which a M. Audius M.f. is attested in a votive inscription in Delos from 113 BCE, in which there is also a N. Stenius M.f. a gens that is more familiar in Thermae Himeraeae, and is attested by Cicero in relation to Delos and Verres (in Verrem 2.2.83–85).
