Intact on all sides, with traces of plaster around the outer edges of the front face, suggesting it was mounted in a wall at some point. Uncertain whether it was always a distinct slab, or was sawn out of the rock on discovery, though the former seems more likely. The rear is rough and unfinished. The front face is arranged into three distinct panels, with three distinct inscriptions. The central text is inset in a panel, which is framed by relief carved columns and a tympanum, which are however incomplete: the column on the left is lightly delineated in relief, with the mouldings below the capital detailed, but the capital itself not detailed; the central area of the tympanum is recessed, but the rest of the pediment only marked out by incised lines; the right column is likewise only marked by incised lines, but faint lines tracing a Corinthian capital are visible. The texts to the left and right, are aligned with this via grid lines. Although broadly similar, there are notable stylistic differences between all three texts, suggesting different masons, and potentially separate moments of carving, and for that reason they are here recorded as separate texts.
