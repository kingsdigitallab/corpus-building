The abbreviation at the end of the text, DD, is standard, and also shows that this text belongs to the period when Halaesa was a Roman municipium (from the time of Augustus onwards). The original size of the inscription can be estimated from the central position of DD, and the stone was probably approximately 60cm wide originally, with only 4-5 letters missing from line 1, and 3-4 from line 2.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The gentilicium (family name) Avianius is known from Centuripe (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000005\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000005\u003C/a>); it is not otherwise recorded in Sicily, although it is common in central and southern Italy. The name Aelius is a very common name, although not very frequent in Sicily; it is attested at Halaesa in the fragmentary text for Alfia (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003574\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003574\u003C/a>) and in the Greek honorific for a rhetor (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003591\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003591\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>It is likely that this text and the fragmentary text for Alfia were set up in honour of female members of the same family, since Alfia is related in some way to Lucius Aelius, as Aviania here is the wife of Publius Aelius. The same type of stone is used for both inscriptions, but the engraver of the two inscriptions is different as the letter forms are clearly different. The text belongs to the first or earlier second century AD.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":428,"html":451},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.17 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":453,"html":454},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
