Roman citizens of tribe Quirina are attested elsewhere in Thermae Himeraeae, and this tribus is predominant in Sicily (see Prag, 2010). Bivona (1994) hypothesizes an African origin of M. Granius Dexter, and posits that the small letters squeezed into the end of line 2 are a later addition, perhaps added after Dexter's death (this is plausible, based upon the presence of the large interpunct after Dextro). Bivona also suggests on palaeographical grounds that lines 3-4 are different in character, and are less rigid, but this is not apparent after autopsy, where the difference in size seems a more plausible explanation (NB compare the variation in 'T' in lines 3 and 4).",{"type":582,"listBibl":583},"bibliography",[584,594],{"type":116,"bibl":585},[586,591,32],{"type":119,"n":120,"citedRange":587,"ptr":589,"ref":590},{"ref":588},{"_":123,"target":124},{"target":126},{"_":128,"target":128},{"type":119,"n":130,"citedRange":131,"ptr":592,"ref":593},{"target":133},{"_":135,"target":135},{"type":137,"bibl":32},[596,597],{"n":388,"url":100,"height":389,"width":390,"desc":101,"surfaceType":385},{"n":388,"url":398,"height":389,"width":390,"desc":101,"surfaceType":395},{"title":599,"body":600,"divs":601,"images":615},"ISic000178.
