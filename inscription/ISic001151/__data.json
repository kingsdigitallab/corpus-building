Kaibel (IG) assumes the omega opening line 1 is an error of the stonecutter, for theta, whereas Brugnone believes Opetreia is a transcription of the Latin nomen, the feminine form of Opetreius, both of which are attested epigraphically (outside of Sicily). In relation to Letois (here in the vocative), Brugnone believes the deceased to have been a freedwoman who adopted the nomen of the person who had freed her. The name Mousaios is common, although not necessarily in Sicily.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":467,"html":495},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0332\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 13 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001397\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001397\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":497,"html":498},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
