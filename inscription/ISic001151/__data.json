Kaibel (IG) assumes the omega opening line 1 is an error of the stonecutter, for theta, whereas Brugnone believes Opetreia is a transcription of the Latin nomen, the feminine form of Opetreius, both of which are attested epigraphically (outside of Sicily). In relation to Letois (here in the vocative), Brugnone believes the deceased to have been a freedwoman who adopted the nomen of the person who had freed her. The name Mousaios is common, although not necessarily in Sicily.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0332\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 13 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001397\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001397\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[486,489,491,493,495,497],{"id":487,"html":488},"editions","\u003Cdiv id=\"edition-interpretive\" lang=\"grc\">  \u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div-interpretive\">  \u003Ca id=\"al1-interpretive\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>Ὀπετρηία Λητώι Μου-\u003Cbr id=\"al2-interpretive\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>σαίου γυνήι χαῖρε χρησ-\u003Cbr id=\"al3-interpretive\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>τὴ καὶ εὐσεβής \u003C/span>\u003C/div>  \u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>\u003C/div>\u003Cdiv id=\"edition-diplomatic\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div-diplomatic\">\u003Ca id=\"al1-diplomatic\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>ΟΠΕΤΡΗΙΑΛΗΤΩΙΜΟΥ\u003Cbr id=\"al2-diplomatic\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>ΣΑΙΟΥΓΥΝΗΙΧΑΙΡΕΧΡΗΣ\u003Cbr id=\"al3-diplomatic\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>ΤΗΚΑΙΕΥΣΕΒΗΣ\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>\u003C/div>",{"id":456,"html":490},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":461,"html":492},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Opetreia Letois, wife of Mousaios, worthy and pious, farewell.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":464,"html":494},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The opening of the inscription is disputed.
