As Dubois writes, thus interpreted 'Le premier nom Ξιγας est énigmatique'. However, from a comparison with other inscribed vessels (see e.g. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020008\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020008\u003C/a>—\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020035\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020035\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020047\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020047\u003C/a>) the sign in question is more likely a mark placed in the centre of the vase - for reasons that cannot be reconstructed with certainty - and it must not be connected with the actual text, although it was evidently made by the same hand. Moreover, the iota looks more like a scratch than a deliberately engraved letter. The text thus read would be γᾶς Μύσχελυς which would certainly make more sense if placed on a horos but which nevertheless remains the most likely reading of the inscription. Moreover, the Doric γᾶς would be justified by the dialectal influence of Gela on Montagna di Marzo. With regard to the name, according to a suggestion by O. Masson mentioned by Dubois (IGDS I nr. 168b), one could consider the second name as an expressive variant of Μύσκελος (see \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020487\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020487\u003C/a>).
