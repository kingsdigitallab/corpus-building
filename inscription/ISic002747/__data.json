In NSA 1904 he presented measurements of all four, photographs of fragments (b) and (c), and outlined texts of (a) and (d). The inventory only records fragments (a), (b) and (c), in equal detail. The first autopsy-based report subsequently was that of Manganaro 1969, who only saw fragments (b) and (c), and subsequent attempts to study the stones, including our own, have only located these two blocks. It is notable that the measurements of the letterheights given by Orsi, in the inventory and the NSA report appear somewhat contradictory and confused, which adds to the difficulty of interpretation: for fragment (a), Orsi gives a letterheight of 24 cm in both reports; for (b) in the inventory 19cm, in NSA 20cm; for (c) in the inventory 30cm, in NSA 20cm; for (d) in NSA 17.5 cm. Compare the measurements above, which are consistently in the range of 18-20 cm. The implication must be that all the letters do indeed belong to a single inscription, being found in apparent close proximity.
