In NSA 1904 he presented measurements of all four, photographs of fragments (b) and (c), and outlined texts of (a) and (d). The inventory only records fragments (a), (b) and (c), in equal detail. The first autopsy-based report subsequently was that of Manganaro 1969, who only saw fragments (b) and (c), and subsequent attempts to study the stones, including our own, have only located these two blocks. It is notable that the measurements of the letterheights given by Orsi, in the inventory and the NSA report appear somewhat contradictory and confused, which adds to the difficulty of interpretation: for fragment (a), Orsi gives a letterheight of 24 cm in both reports; for (b) in the inventory 19cm, in NSA 20cm; for (c) in the inventory 30cm, in NSA 20cm; for (d) in NSA 17.5 cm. Compare the measurements above, which are consistently in the range of 18-20 cm. The implication must be that all the letters do indeed belong to a single inscription, being found in apparent close proximity. Note that Manganaro and Orsi both suggested the text ran over more than one line, in Orsi's case the argument being based upon the variation in letter height. It is not clear that this is necessary, either on the grounds of lettersize (the actual variation does not seem meaningful), nor on simple questions of space, as the Dipylon superstructure was over 10m wide, with 6-7 letters to a metre.","The restoration of the text is obviously highly speculative, given the limited surviving fragments. Manganaro (1969: 289) proposed attributing the text to Hieronymos, linking it to his intepretation of the coin production in the very final phase of Syracusan activity prior to the Roman conquest, but this seems implausible. Beste and Mertens (2015: 293), by contrast, associate the fragments with the building works attributed to Agathokles (as did Winter, Karlsson and Lehmler). Orsi suggested Dionysius I, but was aware that he never formally had the title of king. The surviving letters do strongly suggest that the word βασιλεὺς appeared twice in the inscription, and if so, then unless two separate actions are recorded, we must be in the period of the joint regency of Hieron and Gelon (or, as Manganaro suggested, the very final period under Hieronymos). Dimartino suggests that the letter forms are third century and clearly implies later third century / Hieronian. Given the horizontal lower stroke of the sigma, this is perhaps more likely, but given the minimal surviving text and the monumental size of the letters, there is very little indeed on which to base a judgement. Note that the letters preserve significant traces of red paint.",{"type":493,"listBibl":494},"bibliography",[495,524],{"type":110,"bibl":496},[497,500,503,506,509,512,515,518,521],{"type":113,"n":114,"citedRange":115,"ptr":498,"ref":499},{"target":117},{"_":119,"target":119},{"type":113,"n":114,"citedRange":121,"ptr":501,"ref":502},{"target":117},{"_":119,"target":119},{"type":113,"n":114,"citedRange":125,"ptr":504,"ref":505},{"target":117},{"_":119,"target":119},{"type":113,"n":129,"citedRange":130,"ptr":507,"ref":508},{"target":132},{"_":134,"target":134},{"type":113,"n":136,"author":137,"title":136,"date":138,"citedRange":139,"ptr":510,"ref":511},{"target":141},{"_":143,"target":143},{"author":145,"date":146,"citedRange":147,"ptr":513,"ref":514},{"target":149},{"_":151,"target":151},{"author":145,"date":153,"citedRange":154,"ptr":516,"ref":517},{"target":156},{"_":158,"target":158},{"author":160,"date":161,"citedRange":162,"ptr":519,"ref":520},{"target":164},{"_":166,"target":166},{"author":168,"date":169,"citedRange":170,"ptr":522,"ref":523},{"target":172},{"_":174,"target":174},{"type":176,"bibl":177},[526,527],{"n":412,"url":94,"height":413,"width":414,"desc":95,"surfaceType":409},{"n":412,"url":419,"height":413,"width":414,"desc":95,"surfaceType":409},{"title":529,"body":530,"divs":531,"images":545},"ISic002747.
