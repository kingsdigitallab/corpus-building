The position of the X at the start of line 9, with at least a partial vacat of one character implied before it in the drawing by Orsi leaves it slightly uncertain exactly what the total age in years recorded was, with a minimum of 33 and a maximum of 53, but 43 seeming the most likely from the spacing on the fragments preserved.
