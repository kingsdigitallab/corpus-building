display in 2022). Manganaro proposed that the fragment formed the ends of lines 3-5 of this inscription in Palermo Archaeological Museum, and this attribution has generally been accepted (e.g. Zambito 2007). Fasolo 2013: 73 no.5 rejected the attribution, but his reasoning is flawed (he suggested that the presence of VA at the start of line 5 in the preserved fragments precluded the integration of the new fragment, and yet at first sight it directly supports it, only that the word division at the end of line 5 in the currently proposed restorations of the text would require minor revision). However, a more serious objection lies in the fact that the new fragment is only half as thick (3.5-3.9 cm) as the existing plaque (6.5 cm), and close study of the letter forms (which have the same height, 60-65mm in the existing plaque; 60mm in the new fragment) also suggests minor differences. It is, additionally, given that the right margin of the new plaque is preserved, extremely hard to restore ARTHI at the end of line 1 of the fragment (required at the end of line 3 of the existing text, given CI at the start of line 4), where autopsy confirms that there appears to be no trace of, or space for, the final two verticals required, and the traces preserved are more readily compatible with e.g. ARI·F or similar, unless a complex triple ligature has been employed (unlikely). The new fragment clearly comes from a very similar and contemporary text, but unless other arguments can be adduced, it should be considered part of a separate text. It is also unclear whether the stone is the same. The existing text of ISic000065 is entirely painted in red, but this is presumably antiquarian recolouring in the earlier 19th century and the absence of paint in the new fragment should not be considered an argument either way.",{"type":547,"listBibl":548},"bibliography",[549,613],{"type":355,"bibl":550},[551,559,570,578,582,589,597,605],{"author":552,"date":553,"citedRange":554,"ptr":555,"ref":557},"Maggiore","1829","292 no.2",{"target":556},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/T4NR9UP5",{"_":558,"target":558},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002795",{"type":560,"n":561,"citedRange":562,"ptr":566,"ref":568},"corpus","CIL",{"ref":563},{"_":564,"target":565},"10.7474","http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/650805",{"target":567},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/GQN8UZSI",{"_":569,"target":569},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589",{"type":571,"n":572,"citedRange":573,"ptr":574,"ref":576},"bulletin","AE","2007.0682",{"target":575},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/R46KDTZX",{"_":577,"target":577},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283",{"type":571,"n":572,"citedRange":579,"ptr":580,"ref":581},"1989.0338c",{"target":575},{"_":577,"target":577},{"type":560,"n":583,"citedRange":584,"ptr":585,"ref":587},"ILMusPalermo","66",{"target":586},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/FZWWPUD6",{"_":588,"target":588},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002142",{"author":590,"date":591,"citedRange":592,"ptr":593,"ref":595},"Raepsaet-Charlier","1974","127",{"target":594},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/PZHQV5MN",{"_":596,"target":596},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001648",{"author":598,"date":599,"citedRange":600,"ptr":601,"ref":603},"Zambito","2007","105 and fig. 1",{"target":602},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/I2845RRS",{"_":604,"target":604},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001503",{"author":606,"date":607,"citedRange":608,"ptr":609,"ref":611},"Fasolo","2013","72-73 no. 4 fig. 34",{"target":610},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/X2SEXMRX",{"_":612,"target":612},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002011",{"type":614,"bibl":615},"discussion",{"author":616,"date":617,"citedRange":618,"ptr":619,"ref":621},"Manganaro","1989","162 no. 4 fig. 4-4a",{"target":620},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/EZMBJ6GN",{"_":622,"target":622},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001831",[624],{"n":345,"url":92,"height":346,"width":347,"desc":93,"surfaceType":342},{"title":626,"body":627,"divs":628,"images":642},"ISic000065.

Manganaro proposed that the fragment formed the ends of lines 3-5 of this inscription in Palermo Archaeological Museum, and this attribution has generally been accepted (e.g. Zambito 2007). Fasolo 2013: 73 no.5 rejected the attribution, but his reasoning is flawed (he suggested that the presence of VA at the start of line 5 in the preserved fragments precluded the integration of the new fragment, and yet at first sight it directly supports it, only that the word division at the end of line 5 in the currently proposed restorations of the text would require minor revision). However, a more serious objection lies in the fact that the new fragment is only half as thick (3.5-3.9 cm) as the existing plaque (6.5 cm), and close study of the letter forms (which have the same height, 60-65mm in the existing plaque; 60mm in the new fragment) also suggests minor differences. It is, additionally, given that the right margin of the new plaque is preserved, extremely hard to restore ARTHI at the end of line 1 of the fragment (required at the end of line 3 of the existing text, given CI at the start of line 4), where autopsy confirms that there appears to be no trace of, or space for, the final two verticals required, and the traces preserved are more readily compatible with e.g. ARI·F or similar, unless a complex triple ligature has been employed (unlikely).
