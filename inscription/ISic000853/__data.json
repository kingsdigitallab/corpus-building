However, late 19th-century exploration of the same cemetery had demonstrated that burials continued into the eighth century AD; some indubitably 4th-6th century finds of bronze jewellery and lamps were associated with fragmentary epitaphs of this type, which were surely residual (Orsi 1896: 346 for a fragment from the epitaph of Claudius, with rhomboid letter forms).

However, late 19th-century exploration of the same cemetery had demonstrated that burials continued into the eighth century AD; some indubitably 4th-6th century finds of bronze jewellery and lamps were associated with fragmentary epitaphs of this type, which were surely residual (Orsi 1896: 346 for a fragment from the epitaph of Claudius, with rhomboid letter forms).
