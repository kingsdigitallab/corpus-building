Indeed, similar epitaphs were found in situ by Orsi in the Grotticelli cemetery above cremation burials packed in ceramic jars; one such epitaph of a certain Valeria was associated with a large bronze coin of Trajan (Orsi 1913: 269, with fig.11) . However, late 19th-century exploration of the same cemetery had demonstrated that burials continued into the eighth century AD; some indubitably 4th-6th century finds of bronze jewellery and lamps were associated with fragmentary epitaphs of this type, which were surely residual (Orsi 1896: 346 for a fragment from the epitaph of Claudius, with rhomboid letter forms). Possibly this text was found broken in a late antique context of this sort.","For correspondence between De Rossi and Wilshere regarding the stone, see Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana VatLat 14273, 1885.339 (letter from Wilshere to De Rossi of May 20th 1885) and Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana VatLat 14273, 1885.509 (August 13th 1885).
