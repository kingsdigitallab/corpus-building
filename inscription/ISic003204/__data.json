Sepulla does not however seem to be otherwise attested as a cognomen. If the suggestion of tribunus militum in line 3 is plausible, this becomes a rare addition to the attested evidence for former soldiers in the coloniae of Sicily, and the stone's form and location would suggest a text from the early years of the colonia.

The shape of the final letter on line 1 seems more favourable to Manganaro's suggestion of Q than Gentili's reading of C. The Quirina tribe is well attested on Sicily. The traces in line two seem only to be resolvable as SEPVLLA and the final trace is compatible with E, to give the necessary dative ending for the cognomen, centred on the stone. Sepulla does not however seem to be otherwise attested as a cognomen. If the suggestion of tribunus militum in line 3 is plausible, this becomes a rare addition to the attested evidence for former soldiers in the coloniae of Sicily, and the stone's form and location would suggest a text from the early years of the colonia.
