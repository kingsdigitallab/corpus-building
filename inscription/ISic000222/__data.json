The new reading of the stone which demonstrates that the praenomen is T(itus) allows for the gens Statilia to be reconstructed here without issue, although again repeating Bivona's caution against any certainties here. Bivona notes the historical presence of T. Statilius Taurus in Sicily after the defeat of Sex. Pompeius and M. Aemilius Lepidus.
