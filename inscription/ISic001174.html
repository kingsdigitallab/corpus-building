Two further fragments, sporadic finds on the site of Halaesa (fragment c in 2007, fragment d undated), were published in 2020 by Arena. The original reports of discovery of the principal fragment reference the existence of a second very mutilated and damaged stele that was therefore not recovered or recorded further. It is most commonly reckoned that Fragment B probably derives from this second stele. Arena argues cogently that fragments C and D belong to this text, and explores the possible hypotheses regarding whether they should be associated with the first stele / fragment A, or with the second and fragment B, concluding with a speculative integration of fragment C into the right hand side of column 2 of fragment B. Fragment D is too small to warrant such speculation.</p>  <p>A further substantial fragment (<a href="http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003651" target="_blank">ISic003651</a>) of similar type, but slightly divergent content was published by Calderone in 1961, and is generally considered to belong to a separate but probably associated text. Arena 2020 offers the most detailed consideration of the relationship, concluding that the stone and text are distinct, but belong within the same socio-economic and political context and is most likely associated to, if separate from, the cadastral text itself.</p>  <!----></section> <section id="bibliography" class="svelte-1h6ll55"><h2 class="svelte-1h6ll55">Bibliography</h2> <dl><dt>Digital editions</dt> <dd><ul><!--[--><li><!--[--><a href="https://www.trismegistos.org/text/492780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TM: 492780</a><!--]--><!----></li><li><!--[!-->EDR: -<!--]--><!----></li><li><!--[!-->EDH: -<!--]--><!----></li><li><!--[--><a href="https://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi_url.php?s_sprache=de&amp;p_edcs_id=EDCS-39102328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDCS: 39102328</a><!--]--><!----></li><li><!--[--><a href="https://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/140657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHI: 140657</a><!--]--><!----></li><li><!--[--><a href="https://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/329609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHI: 329609</a><!--]--><!----></li><li><!--[--><a href="https://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/333187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHI: 333187</a><!--]--><!----></li><!--]--></ul></dd> <!--[--><dt>Printed editions</dt> <dd><ul class="bibliography-list"><!--[--><!--[--><li><!--[--><!----><span>G.

Two further fragments, sporadic finds on the site of Halaesa (fragment c in 2007, fragment d undated), were published in 2020 by Arena. The original reports of discovery of the principal fragment reference the existence of a second very mutilated and damaged stele that was therefore not recovered or recorded further. It is most commonly reckoned that Fragment B probably derives from this second stele. Arena argues cogently that fragments C and D belong to this text, and explores the possible hypotheses regarding whether they should be associated with the first stele / fragment A, or with the second and fragment B, concluding with a speculative integration of fragment C into the right hand side of column 2 of fragment B. Fragment D is too small to warrant such speculation.",{_:"A further substantial fragment () of similar type, but slightly divergent content was published by Calderone in 1961, and is generally considered to belong to a separate but probably associated text. Arena 2020 offers the most detailed consideration of the relationship, concluding that the stone and text are distinct, but belong within the same socio-economic and political context and is most likely associated to, if separate from, the cadastral text

Two further fragments, sporadic finds on the site of Halaesa (fragment c in 2007, fragment d undated), were published in 2020 by Arena. The original reports of discovery of the principal fragment reference the existence of a second very mutilated and damaged stele that was therefore not recovered or recorded further. It is most commonly reckoned that Fragment B probably derives from this second stele. Arena argues cogently that fragments C and D belong to this text, and explores the possible hypotheses regarding whether they should be associated with the first stele / fragment A, or with the second and fragment B, concluding with a speculative integration of fragment C into the right hand side of column 2 of fragment B. Fragment D is too small to warrant such speculation.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>A further substantial fragment (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003651\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003651\u003C/a>) of similar type, but slightly divergent content was published by Calderone in 1961, and is generally considered to belong to a separate but probably associated text. Arena 2020 offers the most detailed consideration of the relationship, concluding that the stone and text are distinct, but belong within the same socio-economic and political context and is most likely associated to, if separate from, the cadastral text itself.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca

Two further fragments, sporadic finds on the site of Halaesa (fragment c in 2007, fragment d undated), were published in 2020 by Arena. The original reports of discovery of the principal fragment reference the existence of a second very mutilated and damaged stele that was therefore not recovered or recorded further. It is most commonly reckoned that Fragment B probably derives from this second stele. Arena argues cogently that fragments C and D belong to this text, and explores the possible hypotheses regarding whether they should be associated with the first stele / fragment A, or with the second and fragment B, concluding with a speculative integration of fragment C into the right hand side of column 2 of fragment B. Fragment D is too small to warrant such speculation.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>A further substantial fragment (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003651\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003651\u003C/a>) of similar type, but slightly divergent content was published by Calderone in 1961, and is generally considered to belong to a separate but probably associated text. Arena 2020 offers the most detailed consideration of the relationship, concluding that the stone and text are distinct, but belong within the same socio-economic and political context and is most likely associated to, if separate from, the cadastral text itself.\u003C/p>  "},{id:"bibliography",html:"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca
