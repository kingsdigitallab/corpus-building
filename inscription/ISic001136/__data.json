The other proposed restoration, adopted by Dubois, Brugnone, et al., is 'aleipterion', a 'place for anointing' in a gymnasium, used also as sudatory. The inscription must record honours for someone who saw to the paving and drainage of the main street between this building and the maritime gates, with stone described by a hapax in Doric form, which seems to signify stone used for sharpening (a whet stone) and so a particularly hard and durable stone. The name of the individual is lost, perhaps originally at the top of the text in the accusative. It is quite possible that another line is lost from above the traces in line 1. The end of the text is also lost, but there is clearly a vacat on the lower right, suggesting only a single word is missing at the start of line 11. Salinas observed a vertical, and traces are visible below the alpha above of what appears to be a Ν. Sicilian honorifics of the Hellenistic period very commonly end εὐνοίας ἕνεκεν (rather than ἕνεκα), and the traces are compatible with the end of ἕνεκεν (albeit slightly squeezed compared to the line above).
