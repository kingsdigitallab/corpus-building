The signs preceding and following the word in the first of them could be trade marks (referring to a quantity?). Dubois interprets them as interpuncts but it is quite clear that the first sign is a gamma, followed by a wedge-shaped sign that is repeated after τέτορες twice. The document can be categorised as a price marks (cf. Johnston 1978, p. 222). Why the same vase is marked with the prices of others has been explained by Johnston in several contributions (but see 1978, p. 222-224), assuming that a buyer/seller might be interested in buying/selling a whole set of vases similar in workmanship and/or decoration. The problem remains, however, that a set consisting of a lekythos and a stamnos is not easily explained: these are in fact vessels with very different uses (sets consisting, for example, of tableware are found elsewhere). Johnston does admit the possibility that 'mixed batches for export' also existed and that these 'graffiti' may refer to 'orders given by traders, along with agreed prices (not immedaitely paid?)' (Johnston 1978, p. 226). στάμνια is a diminutive, less common than στάμνοι, and may designate vessels similar to a pelike, as in this case. It is followed by another diminutive, λακύθιον (for λήκῠθος) which occurs here for the first time in its Doric form, followed by an also rare form, ἔνο, equivalent to ἔνεστι and known, as Dubois points out, from two passages of the Anecdota Oxoniensia I (p. 170 and 176), where it is said to be a Doric and Aeolic form, and in Epicharmus (Pseudepicharmea, ed. Austin, CGF in Pap. rep. 1973, p. 79, nr. 86, 1. 5). Johnston considers ἔνο according to the meaning of its equivalent ἔνεστι on a krater from Naples (I.Napoli II 182) and ἐνθήματα on a (unpublished?) red-figure bell-krater from Montesarchio (end of 5th c. BCE) as 'contents'. Also τριτᾱ́μορα is Doric form (for τριτήμορα). The singular form (τριτήμορον) occurs in a fragment of the poet Philemon from Syracuse (ed. Kock, Comicorum Atticorum fragmenta, vol. 2, fr. 74), quoted by Pollux (9.66). It means three quarters of an obolus (it is therefore not clear why it is in the plural). \u003C/p>  ",{"id":362,"html":418},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Arena 2002 137 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001373\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001373\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Dubois 1989 169 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000187\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000187\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Johnston 1978 224-225 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001403\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001403\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Johnston 1973 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001905\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001905\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":420,"html":421},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
