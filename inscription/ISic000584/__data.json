Prestianni Giallombardo 1993a: Tav.1). The form of the letters suggests a text of the first century AD. Limbricius is probably of Campanian origin, and Puteoli specifically, as suggested by the other evidence for the family and tribe; Cicero attests to the interest of businessmen from Puteoli in Sicily (Verr. 2.5.154; see further Facella 2006: 210-211; the Falerna tribe is not otherwise attested in Sicily, see Prag 2010).
