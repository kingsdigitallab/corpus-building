The text and the act it records may be contemporary with the fragmentary honorific (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000802\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000802\u003C/a>) which appears to record work involving the basilica. The building is also mentioned in the bronze honorific for Nemenios (\u003Ca href=\"http://doi.org/10.1163/1874-6772_seg_a59_1100\" target=\"_blank\">SEG 59.1100\u003C/a>), which is of an earlier date and probably refers to an earlier phase of the same building (first century BC). This text is likely to belong to the first or second century AD.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp> There continues to be debate over whether the term 'basilica' is intended to designate, or originally evolved to designate, building form or simply function. Buildings termed ‘basilica’, especially in the Republican period, have considerable variety of form; but they also have considerable variety of use (see Gros, P. 1996. L’architecture romaine au début du IIIe siècle av. J.-C. à la fin du Haut-Empire, vol. 1, Les monuments publics (Paris), at 238-55). As David has noted, basilicae served a judicial role alongside others, hosting the tribunals of Roman officials (David, J.-M. 1983. Le tribunal dans le basilique: évolution fonctionelle et symbolique de la République à l’Empire. In AA.VV. Architecture et société de l'archaïsme grec à la fin de la république romaine (Rome 2-4 décembre 1980) (CEFR 66). Rome: EFR. 219-241, at 219-28). Cicero’s Verrines attest to the use of porticoes in the agorai of the cities of Sicily by Verres and his subordinates for the administration of provincial government (Cic. \u003Ca href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi005.perseus-lat1:2.3.77\" target=\"_blank\">Verr. 3.77\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi005.perseus-lat1:2.4.85\" target=\"_blank\">4.85\u003C/a>-86), and it is therefore very likely that the building called the basilica at Halaesa is part or the whole of the porticoed building standing on the agora (cf. Scibona, G. 2009b. L'Agorà (scavi 1970-2004). In G. Scibona and G. Tigano (eds), Alaisa-Halaesa.
