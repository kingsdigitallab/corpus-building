Buildings termed ‘basilica’, especially in the Republican period, have considerable variety of form; but they also have considerable variety of use (see Gros, P. 1996. L’architecture romaine au début du IIIe siècle av. J.-C. à la fin du Haut-Empire, vol. 1, Les monuments publics (Paris), at 238-55). As David has noted, basilicae served a judicial role alongside others, hosting the tribunals of Roman officials (David, J.-M. 1983. Le tribunal dans le basilique: évolution fonctionelle et symbolique de la République à l’Empire. In AA.VV. Architecture et société de l'archaïsme grec à la fin de la république romaine (Rome 2-4 décembre 1980) (CEFR 66). Rome: EFR. 219-241, at 219-28). Cicero’s Verrines attest to the use of porticoes in the agorai of the cities of Sicily by Verres and his subordinates for the administration of provincial government (Cic. \u003Ca href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi005.perseus-lat1:2.3.77\" target=\"_blank\">Verr. 3.77\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi005.perseus-lat1:2.4.85\" target=\"_blank\">4.85\u003C/a>-86), and it is therefore very likely that the building called the basilica at Halaesa is part or the whole of the porticoed building standing on the agora (cf. Scibona, G. 2009b. L'Agorà (scavi 1970-2004). In G. Scibona and G. Tigano (eds), Alaisa-Halaesa.

The height of the stone is broadly similar across all three (27.5-29 cm), and the letter heights are not dissimilar (150-155 mm in 35; 155 in ISic003581; 155-165 in ISic003582); however, there is some variation in the letter forms and the style of their cutting, and the form of the slabs varies (this text is 4cm thick at the top, down to c.2.7 cm along the bottom; ISic003581 is 3.5cm thick at the top and 4 cm thick at the bottom; ISic003582 is thinner, 2cm at top, 2.7cm at bottom, and has a moulding along the bottom edge).
