date, by means of the eponymous priest or magistrate of the city (presumably Heloros). The nature of the eponym at Heloros is not known, but it is possible that it was an amphipolis, as at Syracuse and in several other cities within the Syracusan orbit. There follow the names of the two gymnasiarchs for the year, and then the list of the neaniskoi, of which only part of the first name is preserved (Manganaro assumes a name in Agatharch- and while this is most likely, other names such as Agatharin are attested). It seems almost certain that the text has been cut-off below, and a list of names of the 'neaniskoi', the youths in the gymnasium would have followed. It is possible that the list concluded with a dedication to a divinity (compare the lists of magistrates dedicated at Akrai). The significance of the term 'Basanos' is opaque. Calderone suggested that it referred to the testing of the youth at the end of their training (Βάσανος is a touchstone, with the metaphorical meaning of a test, or inquiry, often under torture); Manganaro and Dubois preferred the idea that it was a toponym, referring to the location of the gymnasium. Comparable texts are attested at Centuripe (, listing the boys who performed with the shield), and Netum ( commemorating the youths of a gymnasium), and elsewhere on the island.",[634,637],{"_":635,"target":636},"ISic002945","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic002945",{"_":638,"target":639},"ISic001060","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001060",{"type":641,"listBibl":642},"bibliography",[643,668],{"type":132,"bibl":644},[645,648,651,656,659,662,665],{"type":135,"n":136,"citedRange":137,"ptr":646,"ref":647},{"target":139},{"_":141,"target":141},{"type":135,"n":143,"citedRange":144,"ptr":649,"ref":650},{"target":146},{"_":148,"target":148},{"type":150,"n":151,"citedRange":652,"ptr":654,"ref":655},{"ref":653},{"_":154,"target":155},{"target":157},{"_":159,"target":159},{"author":161,"date":162,"ptr":657,"ref":658},{"target":164},{"_":166,"target":166},{"author":168,"date":169,"citedRange":170,"ptr":660,"ref":661},{"target":172},{"_":174,"target":174},{"author":176,"date":177,"citedRange":178,"ptr":663,"ref":664},{"target":180},{"_":182,"target":182},{"author":168,"date":184,"citedRange":185,"ptr":666,"ref":667},{"target":187},{"_":189,"target":189},{"type":191,"bibl":192},[670],{"n":448,"url":115,"height":449,"width":450,"desc":116,"surfaceType":445},{"title":672,"body":673,"divs":674,"images":688},"ISic001476.
