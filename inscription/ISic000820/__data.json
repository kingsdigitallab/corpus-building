The fourth letter is quite clearly an E: the curvature and erosion of the stone mean that the upper and middle bars of the E are very faint, but the lower bar is absolutely clear. The traces which Manganaro suggested were compatible with N at the end of the same line appear rather to belong to a letter R, in a superscript position following the D in line 4, as is more clearly visible at the end of line 5.\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line 6\">Line.6: \u003Cspan>Manganaro did not comment on the traces of one or more letters visible below line 5.

These two elements suggest that the inscription referred to an act of building / euergetism related to the construction, repair, or decoration of the aedes. Given the curving form of the fragment, the suggestion by MANGANARO (1961, p.131) that this might be part of a cylindrical altar is appealing, although part of a statue base or other monument is no less plausible. The preserved section of the rear face suggests that this was either a relief monument, or a hollow cylindrical one.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The rarity of words beginning care- suggests that line 3 begins with the continuation of a word such as aedificare from the previous line. There is no obvious parallel for the form DR. Given its position in the text, seemingly near the end, and separated by the unusual double interpunct, it is reasonable to treat it as an unusual form of abbreviation of the very frequent D(ecreto) D(ecurionum), i.e. D(ec)r(eto) D(ecu)r(ionum) (so already MANGANARO 1961, p. 131). There is no reason to think that the letters were added later (as was suggested by MANGANARO who did not note the second example at the end of line 4), since this is already an atypical form of abbreviation, and there is nothing about the engraving to suggest the letters are by a different hand.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>If the letters DR DR are expanded as decreto decurionum, then this text may attest to the status of Hadranum in the imperial period as being that of a Latin municipium, but no certainty is possible (for the problems of municipal status in imperial period Sicily, see (inter alia), D.
