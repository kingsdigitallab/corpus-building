The gap at the end of line 2 cannot accommodate more than 4 characters, and so Mauceri's suggestion of Nymphodoros cannot stand; Kaibel and Brugnone's suggestion of Nymphon, while not the only possibility is certainly the most likely, as being the only other form in 'Nymph-' regularly attested on the island (following LGPN). The fifth line appears to have been deliberately erased, but is mostly legible. Brugnone dates the inscription narrowly to the first quarter of the third century BCE, but it is difficult to see on what basis - palaeography alone certainly does not allow of such a narrow date (and would suggest a slightly later date, c.250-150?). Perhaps the assumption was that such a dedication should pre-date the Punic wars and the Roman conquest? A later date seems much more likely.",{"type":585,"listBibl":586},"bibliography",[587,628],{"type":449,"bibl":588},[589,600,606,616,621],{"type":590,"n":591,"citedRange":592,"ptr":596,"ref":598},"corpus","IG",{"ref":593},{"_":594,"target":595},"14.0313","https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760",{"target":597},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/Q2SBPG9F",{"_":599,"target":599},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072",{"type":590,"n":601,"citedRange":454,"ptr":602,"ref":604},"IGMusTermini",{"target":603},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/9WZ7KU5C",{"_":605,"target":605},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001397",{"type":607,"n":608,"author":609,"title":608,"date":610,"citedRange":611,"ptr":612,"ref":614},"bulletin","NSA","Fiorelli","1877","226",{"target":613},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/4MCP2PVV",{"_":615,"target":615},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392",{"author":617,"date":610,"citedRange":618,"ptr":619},"Mauceri","233-234",{"target":620},"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/MJSNB8G5",{"type":590,"n":622,"citedRange":623,"ptr":624,"ref":626},"SGDI","3248",{"target":625},"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/JB4GMPBH",{"_":627,"target":627},"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000817",{"type":629,"bibl":254},"discussion",[631,632,633],{"n":425,"url":139,"height":426,"width":427,"desc":140,"surfaceType":422},{"n":425,"url":435,"height":426,"width":427,"desc":140,"surfaceType":432},{"n":425,"url":442,"height":426,"width":427,"desc":140,"surfaceType":439},{"title":635,"body":636,"divs":637,"images":651},"ISic001132.
