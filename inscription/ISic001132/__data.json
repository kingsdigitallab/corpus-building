The fifth line appears to have been deliberately erased, but is mostly legible. Brugnone dates the inscription narrowly to the first quarter of the third century BCE, but it is difficult to see on what basis - palaeography alone certainly does not allow of such a narrow date (and would suggest a slightly later date, c.250-150?). Perhaps the assumption was that such a dedication should pre-date the Punic wars and the Roman conquest?
