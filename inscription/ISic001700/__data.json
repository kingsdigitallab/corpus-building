Ampolo 2022 outlines the probable relationships between multiple of the attested individuals of at least two elite families in Segesta documented by this and other inscriptions. The word 'ephebikon' is not previously attested in the specific use which must be intended here, of a space set aside for the ephebes (the 'ephebeum' of Vitruvius). The room where the statue base was found shows evidence of wall graffiti (to be analysed) and some benches around the perimeter, and is located immediately to the south of the agora.
