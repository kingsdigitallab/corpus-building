The reading of the epithet is certain: for this reason, as Kaibel already noticed, there is no need to amend the text. The epithet  does not seem to be attested elsewhere in Greek texts; it could indicate “the lover of the army or of the fleet ()” or “the lover of the stola ()”. Rizzone (2009: 202) translates the epithet as “mistress of the fleet”, but already Bertucci (1846: 32) and more recently Korhonen (2004: 213) and Cassia (2020) believe that the epithet refers to  and expresses the status of Ioulia Galene as a freeborn Roman matron. As a matter of fact, the deceased was a Roman citizen, as attested by the nomen . Even though the name Γαλήνη may seem to be a speaking name (“stillness of the sea”) related to the fleet, it seems to have been a female name quite common in the imperial age. Ioulia could have used the epithet as a synonym of the expressions  or  recurring in several inscriptions and papyri, especially from the 2nd-3rd century CE (Cassia 2020: 66-68). The compound would thus be in line with other epithets found in funerary inscriptions and inspired by the family and social virtues of the deceased, such as  or .
