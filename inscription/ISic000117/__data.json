Bivona is also correct to doubt whether there is room on the right side of the stone for the three letters usually used for a tribal abbreviation. Whilst the vertical stroke at the end of line 1 is possibly a P, this is uncertain given damage. Thus, Bivona's tentative suggestion that Popillius is enrolled in the Pollia tribe is possible, but uncertain. As Bivona correctly emphasises, this cannot be the same Popillius as the Gaius Popillius Priscus, of tribe Maecia, attested in  also from Thermae Himeraeae. Bivona is correct to suggest that it is impossible that our Popillius belonged to tribe Maecia instead, as comparison with the M in line 2 excludes M as a possibility for the unclear letter at the end of line 1. Bivona suggests that Popillius' city of Pollentia, identified in line 2, must be that in Liguria (Italy) as Pollentia in Picenum and Pollentia on the island of Majorca were both registered in tribe Velina, and it is impossible to see a V for the unidentified letter at the end of line 1.",{"_":546,"target":547},"ISic000099","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000099",{"type":549,"listBibl":550},"bibliography",[551,564],{"type":116,"bibl":552},[553,558,561],{"type":119,"n":120,"citedRange":554,"ptr":556,"ref":557},{"ref":555},{"_":123,"target":124},{"target":126},{"_":128,"target":128},{"type":119,"n":132,"citedRange":133,"ptr":559,"ref":560},{"target":135},{"_":137,"target":137},{"author":141,"date":142,"citedRange":143,"ptr":562,"ref":563},{"target":145},{"_":147,"target":147},{"type":151,"bibl":32},[566],{"n":407,"url":94,"height":408,"width":409,"desc":95,"surfaceType":404},{"title":568,"body":569,"divs":570,"images":584},"ISic000117.

Bivona is right to doubt whether, after the patronymic at the end of line 1, there was an indication of tribe and cognomen. Bivona is also correct to doubt whether there is room on the right side of the stone for the three letters usually used for a tribal abbreviation. Whilst the vertical stroke at the end of line 1 is possibly a P, this is uncertain given damage. Thus, Bivona's tentative suggestion that Popillius is enrolled in the Pollia tribe is possible, but uncertain. As Bivona correctly emphasises, this cannot be the same Popillius as the Gaius Popillius Priscus, of tribe Maecia, attested in \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000099\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000099\u003C/a> also from Thermae Himeraeae. Bivona is correct to suggest that it is impossible that our Popillius belonged to tribe Maecia instead, as comparison with the M in line 2 excludes M as a possibility for the unclear letter at the end of line 1. Bivona suggests that Popillius' city of Pollentia, identified in line 2, must be that in Liguria (Italy) as Pollentia in Picenum and Pollentia on the island of Majorca were both registered in tribe Velina, and it is impossible to see a V for the unidentified letter at the end of line 1.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/650797\" target=\"_blank\">10.7366\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 35 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1988 49 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[571,573,575,577,579,581],{"id":116,"html":572},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">·\u003C/span>].O.ILLIOPF.[..?](\u003Cem>scil.\u003C/em> TRIBU)\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]DOMOPOLLENT[..]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":526,"html":574},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"1\">1: \u003Cspan>Although it is extremely likely that the first and third letters on the stone are both Ps, Bivona does not record that this identification is not uncertain due to damage to the stone.\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"1\">\u003Cspan>Bivona does not acknowledge that the final P on line 1 is possible, but not certain, given damage to the stone.
