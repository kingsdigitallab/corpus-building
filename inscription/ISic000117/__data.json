Bivona is also correct to doubt whether there is room on the right side of the stone for the three letters usually used for a tribal abbreviation. Whilst the vertical stroke at the end of line 1 is possibly a P, this is uncertain given damage. Thus, Bivona's tentative suggestion that Popillius is enrolled in the Pollia tribe is possible, but uncertain. As Bivona correctly emphasises, this cannot be the same Popillius as the Gaius Popillius Priscus, of tribe Maecia, attested in  also from Thermae Himeraeae. Bivona is correct to suggest that it is impossible that our Popillius belonged to tribe Maecia instead, as comparison with the M in line 2 excludes M as a possibility for the unclear letter at the end of line 1. Bivona suggests that Popillius' city of Pollentia, identified in line 2, must be that in Liguria (Italy) as Pollentia in Picenum and Pollentia on the island of Majorca were both registered in tribe Velina, and it is impossible to see a V for the unidentified letter at the end of line 1.",{"_":547,"target":548},"ISic000099","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000099",{"type":550,"listBibl":551},"bibliography",[552,565],{"type":120,"bibl":553},[554,559,562],{"type":123,"n":124,"citedRange":555,"ptr":557,"ref":558},{"ref":556},{"_":127,"target":128},{"target":130},{"_":132,"target":132},{"type":123,"n":136,"citedRange":137,"ptr":560,"ref":561},{"target":139},{"_":141,"target":141},{"author":145,"date":146,"citedRange":147,"ptr":563,"ref":564},{"target":149},{"_":151,"target":151},{"type":155,"bibl":32},[567],{"n":407,"url":96,"height":408,"width":409,"desc":97,"surfaceType":404},{"title":569,"body":570,"divs":571,"images":586},"ISic000117.
