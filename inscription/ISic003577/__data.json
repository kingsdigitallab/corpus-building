Dedications to the Genius of Augustus are commonly paired with dedications to the (Augustan) Lares. Line 1 therefore probably originally read in full: Genio Augusti et Laribus Augustis. Line 2 might have contained the name of a second individual, but the available space is probably not sufficient for this, and it is more likely that the cognomen of Cornelius was followed by an indication of the position he held (sevir or sevir Augustalis) and an abbreviation such as S(ua) P(ecunia) F(ecit) (i.e. set it up at his own expense).",{"_":441,"ref":442},"The final letter of line two could be I, L, or possibly H; it is clear that there is no stroke extending to the right from the upper part of the letter, and it seems unlikely that there is one from the mid-point; but it is impossible to be certain about the base of the stroke. Possible names therefore include Euplus (Greek ), which is attested in Sicily, as well as in southern Italy (Campania) and elsewhere, or perhaps Euphraeus (Greek ), which is attested in Hellenistic Sicily including at Akrai, Camarina, and Taormina.

Novità epigrafiche sul culto del Genius Augusti in Italia, in M. G. Angeli Bertinelli and A. Donati (eds.), Serta Antiqua et Mediaevalia VI. Usi e abusi epigrafici (Rome), 217-236, at 224-227). A Sicilian example can be found on Lipari (), and perhaps also at Centuripe (). Consequently, the exact date is uncertain, but as Manganaro ((1989) 191 no.81 fig.87) observes in discussion of the Lipari example, the lack of distinction between C and G may suggest an earlier (i.e. Augustan) date, rather than later in the first century AD.",[452,455],{"_":453,"target":454},"ISic000771","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000771",{"_":456,"target":457},"ISic000699","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000699",{"type":459,"listBibl":460},"bibliography",[461,465],{"type":120,"bibl":462},{"author":123,"date":124,"citedRange":125,"ptr":463,"ref":464},{"target":127},{"_":129,"target":129},{"type":133,"bibl":30},[467,468,469,470,471],{"n":369,"url":95,"height":370,"width":371,"desc":96,"surfaceType":366},{"n":369,"url":376,"height":377,"width":378,"desc":96,"surfaceType":366},{"n":369,"url":385,"height":378,"width":377,"desc":96,"surfaceType":382},{"n":369,"url":389,"height":378,"width":377,"desc":96,"surfaceType":382},{"n":369,"url":396,"height":378,"width":377,"desc":96,"surfaceType":393},{"title":473,"body":474,"divs":475,"images":490},"ISic003577.
