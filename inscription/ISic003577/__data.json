Dedications to the Genius of Augustus are commonly paired with dedications to the (Augustan) Lares. Line 1 therefore probably originally read in full: Genio Augusti et Laribus Augustis. Line 2 might have contained the name of a second individual, but the available space is probably not sufficient for this, and it is more likely that the cognomen of Cornelius was followed by an indication of the position he held (sevir or sevir Augustalis) and an abbreviation such as S(ua) P(ecunia) F(ecit) (i.e. set it up at his own expense).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The final letter of line two could be I, L, or possibly H; it is clear that there is no stroke extending to the right from the upper part of the letter, and it seems unlikely that there is one from the mid-point; but it is impossible to be certain about the base of the stroke.
