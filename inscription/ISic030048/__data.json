Isler draws comparison with the Entella tablets, and it is a reasonable assumption that this is the remains of a public text, possibly originally on display in the area of the agora or associated public buildings. The letter forms are compatible with a third-century BCE date, but precision is impossible. Isler reads the first letter of line 3 as Ρ, but omicron seems much more likely, firstly because of the unlikely sequence ΡΣ and secondly by comparison with the rho in line 1 and the theta in line 2, and the absence of any trace of a straight vertical on the left side of the letter.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":411,"html":443},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 46.1257 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Isler 1995 20 with fig. 9 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002488\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002488\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Isler 1996 54 with taf. 10.5 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002489\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002489\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Isler 2012 234 with n.41 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001361\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001361\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  ",{"id":445,"html":446},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence ",[448,450],{"image":99,"thumb":449,"title":100},"ISic030048_tiled-thumb.tif",{"image":361,"thumb":451,"title":100},"ISic030048-thumb.jpg"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
