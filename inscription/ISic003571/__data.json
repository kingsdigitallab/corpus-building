attestations from the second and first century  BC of individuals at Halaesa with Greek names, called Diogenes Lapiron and Apollodorus Lapiron (see , , , and -28; Facella 2006: 230-232). This individual must be a Roman citizen, with the Greek name Lapiron forming the cognomen, and he is presumably a relative of those previously known. The suggested restorations of the other lines (especially line 4) allows for perhaps as many as 10 letters before Lapironi, but probably not more. This would be just sufficient for praenomen, short nomen, and filiation (or a slightly longer nomen if filiation were omitted). The fact that a member of one of the leading families of Halaesa in the Hellenistic/Republican period can be seen holding a position within the Roman state (praefectus fabrum) and (probably) being honoured in his hometown with the priesthood of Augustus for life is important evidence for continuity of the local elite in Halaesa through the troubled period of the civil wars and into the early Empire (there is no direct evidence for events in Halaesa during the civil wars).",[476,479,482,485],{"_":477,"target":478},"ISic001176","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001176",{"_":480,"target":481},"ISic000800","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000800",{"_":483,"target":484},"ISic001175","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001175",{"_":486,"target":487},"Cicero, In Verrem 2.2.19","http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi005.perseus-lat1:2.2.19",{"_":489,"ref":490},"In line 2, the restoration of praefectus fabrum is unproblematic. Iteration of the position 10 times (i.e. for ten years) is unusual, but not unparalleled (see e.g. , Saepinum, for 15 times). Several other individuals in Sicily (mostly early Empire) are attested as holding the office of praefectus fabrum, at Messina (, lost), at Catania (),  and at Termini ( (lost) and ). Depending upon the available space to the left, a further office is likely to have been listed, and is more likely to have been one in imperial / military service, rather than municipal, given the sequence of posts, viz. praefectus fabrum in line 2 followed by a municipal preisthood in line 3 (the general of such military posts with municipal ones is common).

The word ending [--]VO in line four appears to stand alone at the centre of the line, and in context can most plausibly be restored as perpetuo, the position of flamen perpetuus (i.e. priest for life) being a relatively common honour in municipal careers.

This individual must be a Roman citizen, with the Greek name Lapiron forming the cognomen, and he is presumably a relative of those previously known. The suggested restorations of the other lines (especially line 4) allows for perhaps as many as 10 letters before Lapironi, but probably not more. This would be just sufficient for praenomen, short nomen, and filiation (or a slightly longer nomen if filiation were omitted). The fact that a member of one of the leading families of Halaesa in the Hellenistic/Republican period can be seen holding a position within the Roman state (praefectus fabrum) and (probably) being honoured in his hometown with the priesthood of Augustus for life is important evidence for continuity of the local elite in Halaesa through the troubled period of the civil wars and into the early Empire (there is no direct evidence for events in Halaesa during the civil wars).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>In line 2, the restoration of praefectus fabrum is unproblematic.
