It is reasonably assumed that the inscription comes from the site of ancient Apollonia, since it has been recorded since the 17th century in re-use in a structural wall of the church of the 'tre santi', which dates back to the 11th/12th century, and within which a number of other pieces of ancient stonework can be seen in re-use also; the church stands within the ancient site. The presence of a demotic abbreviation (to be corrected to 'LAB') finds parallels in a number of other texts from Hellenistic Sicily, and in particular from Halaesa (e.g. ) and Kaleakte () among nearby sites. The specific abbreviation 'lab' is attested at Halaesa (SEG 59.1100) and in IGDS II.40, a list of names on lead that may come from the area of Siracusa. The presence of identical such abbreviations at, e.g., both Halaesa and Akrai, however, demonstrates that this particular example cannot serve to prove that the text originally came from Halaesa. Dedications 'to all the gods' are also reasonably widespread in Hellenistic Sicily, both at Halaesa and elsewhere. At Halaesa the formula consistently stands at the head of the text, however (e.g. ); the final position, as here, finds parallels, for instance, at Tauromenion (e.g. )",[517,520,523,524],{"_":518,"target":519},"ISic000800","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000800",{"_":521,"target":522},"ISic003628","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003628",{"_":518,"target":519},{"_":525,"target":526},"ISic003125","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003125",{"_":528,"ref":529}," is a reasonably common name, with at least 11 other attestations in Sicily; , by contrast, is rare and not attested otherwise in Sicily.",[530,533],{"_":531,"target":532},"Andron","http://clas-lgpn2.classics.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/lgpn_search.cgi?namenoaccents=%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%94%CE%A1%CE%A9%CE%9D",{"_":534,"target":535},"Thrasios","http://clas-lgpn2.classics.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/lgpn_search.cgi?namenoaccents=%CE%98%CE%A1%CE%91%CE%A3%CE%99%CE%9F%CE%A3",{"_":537,"ref":538},"Excavation of ancient Apollonia has to date been limited (see Bonanno 2008), but it is clear that there was a city there in the Hellenistic period and the city is .",{"_":539,"target":540}," attested in several ancient sources including the Verrines (Cic. 2 Verr. 3.103; 5.86, 90).
