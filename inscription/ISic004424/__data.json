Bella'. The form of the text, including the line above the first two letters, is very similar to the second and third lines of \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001404\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001404\u003C/a>, preserved in Adrano museum, and from the right bank of the Simeto river (see that text for further commentary). The spacing in the text of Gualtherus, and the presence of the line above the first two letters, encourages the idea that the text was on a boundary stone, in large letters, divided over two or three lines, as in the case of the Adrano stone (whether the 'L' was on a separate line or not, in this example, can only be guessed). A second, very similar text (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001338\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001338\u003C/a>) was recorded by Gualtherus, and both are repeated in CIG and IG. Manganaro (1994) briefly discusses these texts, and argues that they should be considered distinct from the set of texts preserved in the manuscript collection of Gaetano Marini, from Sferri, in the territory of Paterno, and reproduced by several scholars, including \u003Ca href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/759ZXHKQ\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrua 1989\u003C/a>, p. 123-124 nr. 471 (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004425\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004425\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004426\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004426\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004427\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004427\u003C/a>); the second and third of those texts are similar to this one, but seemingly not identical. The only text actually preserved is that in Adrano museum.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":411,"html":448},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 [1625] 9 no.57 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0518\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 45.1353 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 3.5733 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1994 173-174 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":450,"html":451},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
