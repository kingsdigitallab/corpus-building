Franz in CIG proposed correcting the end of lines 1 and 2 so that the order was reversed. Kaibel in IG instead despaired of making sense of what he assumed to be either errors of Castelli or the result of a forgery. It is unclear whether this is in fact one individual with multiple names with the patronymic unusually placed first, or two separate individuals. Without the possibility of checking the stone, no certainty is possible. Tuendus is not a common name but is attested in Italy in the imperial period, and the text must be imperial in date (second to fourth century?).
