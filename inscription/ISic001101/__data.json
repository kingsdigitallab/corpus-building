It is likely that this was to commemorate his service as the Sicilian commander of the honorific garrison of 200 men stationed at Eryx, described by Diodorus Siculus (4.83.7), as well as Cicero (Verr. 5.124), and for which the 17 Sicilian towns that had remained most loyal to Rome were responsible (see  pp. 81-82 with references). A similar text can be seen in CIL 10.7258 = . The name  is moderately well attested in Sicily as well is in the wider Greek world, whereas Seisurion is assumed to be an indigenous form. The Lucius Caecilius L.f.
