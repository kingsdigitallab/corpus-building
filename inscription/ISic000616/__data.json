The suggestion of De Miro to read  is less plausible. De Miro's suggestion to read  as 'thrice pius' rather than tribal and cognomen/epithet cannot be followed. The first part of the text continued on another block to the left. The interpunct after 'suam' in line 2 and the edge of the stone suggest this is the right hand end of the text. The layout could imply another line below on another block, perhaps containing the explanation for the honours. It has been generally assumed that the stone belongs to the so-called 'Oratory of Phalaris', which in turn was suggested by the excavator Marconi (1926) to be a heroon. The idea that it was a tomb or heroon, rather than a temple was firmly rejected by Wilson  (1990: 31 and 356 n.102). Campagna (2007) has however rightly questioned whether there is in fact any evidence for the association. The block is the same stone as the temple; it does however show no traces of the stucco which covers much of the exterior of the temple. The formulation of nominative individual and then accusative for the mother makes it more likely that this is an honorific (perhaps a statue base?) rather than a funerary inscription, albeit using the Greek accusative for the honorand (Latin would ordinarily use a dative) - this latter feature could either imply a Roman / Italian immigrant to the island or else a 'romanised' Sicilian. Honours of this sort for a woman in Latin epigraphy at this date are rare.\n                    ",[463,466,468],{"_":464,"rend":465},"T(iberi) f(iliam)","italic",{"_":467,"rend":465},"devote",{"_":469,"rend":465},"ter pius",{"type":471,"listBibl":472},"bibliography",[473,495],{"type":109,"bibl":474},[475,480,483,486,489,492],{"type":112,"n":113,"citedRange":476,"ptr":478,"ref":479},{"ref":477},{"_":116,"target":117},{"target":119},{"_":121,"target":121},{"author":123,"date":124,"citedRange":125,"ptr":481,"ref":482},{"target":127},{"_":129,"target":129},{"author":131,"date":132,"citedRange":133,"ptr":484,"ref":485},{"target":135},{"_":137,"target":137},{"type":139,"n":140,"author":141,"title":140,"date":142,"citedRange":143,"ptr":487,"ref":488},{"target":145},{"_":147,"target":147},{"author":123,"date":149,"citedRange":150,"ptr":490,"ref":491},{"target":152},{"_":154,"target":154},{"author":156,"date":157,"citedRange":158,"ptr":493,"ref":494},{"target":160},{"_":162,"target":162},{"type":164,"bibl":31},[497,498],{"n":399,"url":94,"height":400,"width":401,"desc":95,"surfaceType":396},{"n":399,"url":407,"height":400,"width":401,"desc":95,"surfaceType":396},{"title":500,"body":501,"divs":502,"images":518},"ISic000616.

The first part of the text continued on another block to the left. The interpunct after 'suam' in line 2 and the edge of the stone suggest this is the right hand end of the text. The layout could imply another line below on another block, perhaps containing the explanation for the honours. It has been generally assumed that the stone belongs to the so-called 'Oratory of Phalaris', which in turn was suggested by the excavator Marconi (1926) to be a heroon. The idea that it was a tomb or heroon, rather than a temple was firmly rejected by Wilson (1990: 31 and 356 n.102). Campagna (2007) has however rightly questioned whether there is in fact any evidence for the association. The block is the same stone as the temple; it does however show no traces of the stucco which covers much of the exterior of the temple. The formulation of nominative individual and then accusative for the mother makes it more likely that this is an honorific (perhaps a statue base?) rather than a funerary inscription, albeit using the Greek accusative for the honorand (Latin would ordinarily use a dative) - this latter feature could either imply a Roman / Italian immigrant to the island or else a 'romanised' Sicilian. Honours of this sort for a woman in Latin epigraphy at this date are rare. \u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/520721\" target=\"_blank\">01.2649\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> De Miro 1988 67-69 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002052\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002052\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 1990 356 n.97, 31 n.102 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001509\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001509\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Marconi NSA 1926 110-111 fig.14 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001392\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> De Miro 2000 95-6, esp. n.160 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002050\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002050\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Campagna 2007 119 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002096\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002096\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[503,505,507,509,511,513,515],{"id":109,"html":504},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]USMFTER&nbsp;&nbsp;PIUS\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">·\u003C/span>.MATREMSUAM\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":445,"html":506},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text from autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"line 2\">line.2: \u003Cspan>[devo]TE, De Miro 2000; the first letter preserves part of an upper horizontal, the second is either an E or an F\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":454,"html":508},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>[---]us Pius, son of Marcus, of the tribe Teretina\u003C/p>  ",{"id":454,"html":510},"\u003Ch2>Italian translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>[---]us Pius figlio di Marco della tribù Teretina [---] sua madre\u003C/p>  ",{"id":459,"html":512},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The surviving traces at the start of line two are most readily compatible in the context with TF, which would be \u003Cspan class=\"italic\">T(iberi) f(iliam)\u003C/span> as the filiation of the honoured mother's name.
