of the 14 inscribed vessels that were part of the grave goods of tomb East 31 of the archaic \n                    necropolis of Montagna di Marzo, part itself of a larger set of objects (on which see Albanese Procelli in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli \n                    2018, pp. 151-182) belonging to two different burials, one more recent than the other, inside a hypogeic chamber with a platform, \n                    which was used for the pottery (and not for the deceased, as in the other hypogeic tombs of this type). The burials were contained in two clay sarcophagi.\n                    The vessels found in the tomb can be divided into two groups (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, 194): large Attic \n                    (imported) drinking vessels (cups, 'stemless cups', a skyphos, i.e. luxury vessels, typically related to the consumption of wine in the symposium);\n                    vessels of different types, all of a smaller size.\n                    To the first group belong 7 vases, of which 3 belong to the deceased in the front of the chamber, 4 to the second, in the back.\n                    On the latter group there are monorematic inscriptions: twice ϝολα ( and ), \n                    three times ϝιταριον (two in its full form,  and this document,\n                    one with an abbreviated form, ϝι ), once γελε ().\n                    Each word appears to be associated with a particular type of vessel (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese 2018, p. 194): \n                    ϝολα to the Attic 'small stemless cup', ϝιταριον to the small colonial oinochoe, γελε to the Attic jug. This has led to the convincing argument \n                    that the inscribed words indicate the contents for which the vessels were intended, a hypothesis in some case confirmed by the root of the words inscribed. \n                    In the case of γελε, the root would in fact appears to be related to the Latin noun for \"ice\", 'as well as, above all, the word γέλα \"πάχνη\" attributed \n                    by Stephanus Byzantius to the language of the Opics and Sikels, and considered constitutive of the name of the city of Gela (and of its homonymous river).' \n                    (editor's translation of Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese 2018, p. 194). All of these inscriptions, with the exception of γελε, whose alphabetical types \n                    are not comparable to those of the other inscriptions, appear to have been written by the same hand.\n                    These types of inscriptions are of great interest, if they can be read as the actual label bearing the name of the content, because they might show an \n                    epigraphic use not otherwise known among the Greek documents of the island (an exception to this consideration might be a still unpublished document \n                    from Selinus of forthcoming publication, see ).",[398,401,404,407,410,413],{"_":399,"target":400},"ISic020732","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020732",{"_":402,"target":403},"ISic020733","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020733",{"_":405,"target":406},"ISic020735","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020735",{"_":408,"target":409},"ISic020737","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020737",{"_":411,"target":412},"ISic020734","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020734",{"_":414,"target":415},"ISic020875","http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020875",{"type":417,"listBibl":418},"bibliography",[419,427],{"type":111,"bibl":420},[421,424],{"type":114,"n":115,"author":116,"date":117,"citedRange":118,"ptr":422,"ref":423},{"target":120},{"_":122,"target":122},{"author":126,"date":127,"citedRange":128,"ptr":425,"ref":426},{"target":130},{"_":132,"target":132},{"type":136,"bibl":428},[429,432],{"author":139,"date":140,"citedRange":141,"ptr":430,"ref":431},{"target":143},{"_":145,"target":145},{"author":139,"date":149,"citedRange":150,"ptr":433,"ref":434},{"target":152},{"_":154,"target":154},[436],{"n":358,"url":86,"height":359,"width":360,"desc":87,"surfaceType":355},{"title":438,"body":439,"divs":440,"images":458},"ISic020736.

On the latter group there are monorematic inscriptions: twice ϝολα (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020732\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020732\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020733\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020733\u003C/a>), three times ϝιταριον (two in its full form, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020735\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020735\u003C/a> and this document, one with an abbreviated form, ϝι \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020737\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020737\u003C/a>), once γελε (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020734\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020734\u003C/a>). Each word appears to be associated with a particular type of vessel (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese 2018, p. 194): ϝολα to the Attic 'small stemless cup', ϝιταριον to the small colonial oinochoe, γελε to the Attic jug. This has led to the convincing argument that the inscribed words indicate the contents for which the vessels were intended, a hypothesis in some case confirmed by the root of the words inscribed. In the case of γελε, the root would in fact appears to be related to the Latin noun for \"ice\", 'as well as, above all, the word γέλα \"πάχνη\" attributed by Stephanus Byzantius to the language of the Opics and Sikels, and considered constitutive of the name of the city of Gela (and of its homonymous river).' (editor's translation of Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese 2018, p. 194). All of these inscriptions, with the exception of γελε, whose alphabetical types are not comparable to those of the other inscriptions, appear to have been written by the same hand. These types of inscriptions are of great interest, if they can be read as the actual label bearing the name of the content, because they might show an epigraphic use not otherwise known among the Greek documents of the island (an exception to this consideration might be a still unpublished document from Selinus of forthcoming publication, see \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020875\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020875\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani Forthcoming MMA? \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Mussinano 1970 no. 12, p. 178 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002413\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002413\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018 164, 183, 186, 190, 194, fig. 112 and fig. 39 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001345\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001345\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2016 figs. 14, 24 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001346\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001346\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[441,443,445,447,449,451,453,455],{"id":111,"html":442},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"scx-Grek\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[..]ΤΑΡΙΟΝ\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":111,"html":444},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"scx-Latn\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>[..]TARION\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":386,"html":446},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>  \u003Cspan>Text after Mussinano 1970\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":391,"html":448},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":391,"html":450},"\u003Ch2>Italian translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":394,"html":452},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>The inscription is on one of the 14 inscribed vessels that were part of the grave goods of tomb East 31 of the archaic necropolis of Montagna di Marzo, part itself of a larger set of objects (on which see Albanese Procelli in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, pp. 151-182) belonging to two different burials, one more recent than the other, inside a hypogeic chamber with a platform, which was used for the pottery (and not for the deceased, as in the other hypogeic tombs of this type). The burials were contained in two clay sarcophagi. The vessels found in the tomb can be divided into two groups (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, 194): large Attic (imported) drinking vessels (cups, 'stemless cups', a skyphos, i.e. luxury vessels, typically related to the consumption of wine in the symposium); vessels of different types, all of a smaller size.
