Against the association, the heights of the lines do not match easily to the heights of the lines on the other fragment, which means that this fragment would have to be placed below the other; but this would entail that the line heights decrease and then increase again, which while not impossible is unlikely. Close study of the letters suggests that they are not exactly identical, although similar: the P in both cases is open, but the eye is formed differently; and A in this text has a serif at its head, which is not to be found in the instance of A in ISic003572.
