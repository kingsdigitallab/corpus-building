In line 2, it is tempting to restore this as a further reference to (and so dedication by) Marcus Paccius (cf. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003572\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003572\u003C/a> and the Augustan coinage of RPC I, nos. 630-633). In line 3, traces of a circular letter are visible, which are compatible with any of O, P, R, B or D.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The excavator, Giacomo Scibona, proposed that this fragment should be associated with \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic003572\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003572\u003C/a>, the fragment mentioning Paccius. In favour of this association, the stone is very similar, and of similar (and slightly varying) thickness, the style of the letters is similar, and although the heights vary they are in the same general range; and the interpuncts are of identical type (and relatively unusual). Against the association, the heights of the lines do not match easily to the heights of the lines on the other fragment, which means that this fragment would have to be placed below the other; but this would entail that the line heights decrease and then increase again, which while not impossible is unlikely.
