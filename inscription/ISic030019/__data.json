The fact that the curse is about their ‘ineffectuality both in word and deed’ proves that they were trainers and/or poets, and/or producers of choruses.\n                    It was then suggested that the author of this curse, Apellis, was himself a competing khoregos, and that Eunikos was in his ‘team’, a star performer of some kind, actor or singer. The prayer is, after all, a request for his success, and Apellis’ ‘love’ for Eunikos is far from being inconsistent with his having a personal interest in his agonistic victory. Kaledias, Sosias ad Melathios are all khoregoi and, as a result, rivals of Eunikos; while Pyrias, Mysskelos and Damophantos are members or supporters of another team.\n                    Apellis’ curse for Eunikos is believed not only to aim at the victory on other khoregoi but also to be an attempt to win the affection of Eunikos himself. In wishing for this sort of charismatic adulation for Eunikos, Apellis inadvertently alerts us to the likely presence of women in the Geloan festival audience.\n                    The new reading of lines 12-13, proposed by Wilson and Favi 2017, does not quite involve an ‘act of sympathetic magic’ as previously thought. In this case Apellis is likely to have uttered some sort of oral spell, ἐπῳδαί, while writing or burying the tablet. While tablets differ cases by cases, spells which accompanied the ritual were probably formulaic, such as maledictions, invocations of chthonic deities, voces magicae. As a result, if ἐπῳδαί is to be accepted, Εὐχά, at l.1, becomes the preferable reading as curse tablets can present supplicative forms to address the gods.\n                    What is striking is that both the sides of the tablet are concerned with τιµή. In the case of the financial transaction on side A, τιµή (the ‘value’ of the cattle, l.5) is the essential matter at stake in the record and, in the curse on side B, the τιµή (honour) is asked to be drawn away from Eunikos’ rivals.

This lead tablet, then, seems to be, in Wilson’s word, “more than a handy piece of writing material that had outlived its initial usefulness: it had a proven power to draw τιμή.”\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 49.1264 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 53.0994 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 57.0905b \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Miller 1973 134 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002516\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002516\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Brugnone 1980-1981 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001462\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001462\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Masson 1984-1985 75-76 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001466\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001466\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Dubois 1989 no. 134b \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000187\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000187\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Lopez-Jimeno 1991 110-131 no. 17 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001858\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001858\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Jordan 1999 206-215 \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Arena 2002 45 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001373\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001373\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Jordan 2007 335-350 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002301\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002301\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 2007 351-377 \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson and Favi 2017 138-140 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002302\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002302\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Jordan 1985 174 no. 91 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001391\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001391\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Franek and Urbanova 2019 33-34 \u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence. \u003C/div>",[676,678,680,682,684,686,688],{"id":108,"html":677},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"grc\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>.ΥΧΑΑΠΕΛΛΙΣΕΠΙΦΙΛΟΤΑΤΙΤΑΙΕΥΝΙϘΟˉ[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">---\u003C/span>]ΜΕˉΔΕΝ[.]ΥΝΙϘΟˉΣΠΕΥ\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>Δ[..]ΟΤΕΡΟΝΕ᾿ΜΕΝΜΕˉΔΕΦΙΝΤΙΟˉΝΑΑΛΛΕΠΑΙΝΕ῀ΚΑΙΕϘΟΝΤΑΚΑΕϘ\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>ΟΝΤΑΚΑΙΦΙΛΕΤΑΝΕΠΙΦΙΛΟΤΑΤΙΤΑΙΕΥΝΙϘΟˉΑΠΟΓΑΡΑΦΟˉΤΟˉ\u003Cbr id=\"al4\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">4\u003C/span>ΣΧΟΡᾹΓΟˉΣΠΑΝΤΑΣΕΠΑΤΕΛΕΙΑΚΕˉΠΕΟˉΝΚΑΙΕΡΓΟˉΝΚΑΙΤ\u003Cbr id=\"al5\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">5\u003C/span>ΟˉΣΠΑΙ῀ΔΙΑΣΑΠΟΤΕΝΟΝΚΑΙΤΟˉΣΠΑΤΕΡΑΣΚΑΠΡΑΚΤΙΑΙΚΕˉΝΑΓΟ῀\u003Cbr id=\"al6\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">6\u003C/span>ΝΙΚΕΧΘΟΣΑΓΟˉΝΟˉΝΟΙΤΙΝΕΣΜΕΠΑΡΕΜΑΠΟΛΕΙΠΟΙΕΝΚΑΛΕΔΙΑΝ\u003Cbr id=\"al7\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">7\u003C/span>[....]ΑΡΑΦΟˉΑΠΑΠΕΛΛΙΟΣΚΑΙΤΟˉΣΣΤΕˉΝΕ῀ΙΠΑΝΤΑΣΕΠΙΜΕΣΟΤΕΡ\u003Cbr id=\"al8\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">8\u003C/span>[.\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">···\u003C/span>]ΕΝΤΑΔΑΣΟˉΣΙΑΝΑΠΟΓΡΑΦΟˉΑΠΟΤΟ῀ΚΑΠΕˉΛΕΙΟˉΑΛΚΙΔΑΝΕΠΙΤΑ\u003Cbr id=\"al9\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">9\u003C/span>[.?...?]ΑΝΘΙΟˉΦΙΛΟΤᾹΤΙΠΥΡΙΑΜΥΣΣΚΕΛΟΝΔᾹΜΟΦΑΝΤΟΝΚΑΙΤΟΝ\u003Cbr id=\"al10\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">10\u003C/span>ΟΝΑΠΟΓΡΑΦΟˉΑΠΟΤΟ῀ΜΠΑΙΔΟˉΝΚΑΙΤΟ῀ΜΠΑΤΕΡΟˉΝΚΑΙΤΟˉΣΑΛΛ\u003Cbr id=\"al11\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">11\u003C/span>[....]ΝΤΑΣΟΙΤΙΝΕΣΕΝΤΑΔΕΑΦΙΚΝΟΙΑΤΟΜΕˉΔΕΝΕΥΝΙΚΟˉΣΠΕΥΔΑΙΟ\u003Cbr id=\"al12\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">12\u003C/span>[....]ΝΓΕΝΕΣΘΑΙΜΕˉΤΑΝΔΡΕΣΙΜΕˉΤΕΓΥΝΑΙΚΕΣΣΙΟΣΟΥΤΟΣΒΟΛΙΜΟˉΣΤΟˉΣΤΕ\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">·\u003C/span>\u003Cbr id=\"al13\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">13\u003C/span>[...?..].ΔΙ..ΤΙΜΑΝΕΡΥΣΑΙΝΤΟΕΥΝΙΚΟˉΙΑΕΝΙΚΑΝΠΑΝΤΕ῀ΕΜΒΟΛΥΜΟ.Ε.\u003Cbr id=\"al14\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">14\u003C/span>[....]ΟΤΑΤΙΤΑΙΕΥΝΙΚΟˉΓΑΡΦΟˉ\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">l.14 reg., orig. άρ\u003C/p>",{"id":591,"html":679},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>  \u003Cspan>Text after Wilson and Favi 2017\u003C/span>  \u003C/span>;

On the basis of letter forms and dialect Miller concludes that certainly Side B and possibly A were inscribed in Gela, around the middle of the fifth century BCE (note the unknown provenance, tablet from the antiquities market). As Wilson states, this lead tablet opens a window onto the festival culture of a Greek community in mid-fifth century Sicily, almost certainly that of the flourishing city-state of Gela at its height. It gives evidence for a festival there that had choral contests, perhaps of some scale, and hints at the mechanics of their operation. As Jordan argues, it is likely that these khoregoi are themselves performers, presumably the participating leaders of choruses. The fact that the curse is about their ‘ineffectuality both in word and deed’ proves that they were trainers and/or poets, and/or producers of choruses. It was then suggested that the author of this curse, Apellis, was himself a competing khoregos, and that Eunikos was in his ‘team’, a star performer of some kind, actor or singer. The prayer is, after all, a request for his success, and Apellis’ ‘love’ for Eunikos is far from being inconsistent with his having a personal interest in his agonistic victory. Kaledias, Sosias ad Melathios are all khoregoi and, as a result, rivals of Eunikos; while Pyrias, Mysskelos and Damophantos are members or supporters of another team. Apellis’ curse for Eunikos is believed not only to aim at the victory on other khoregoi but also to be an attempt to win the affection of Eunikos himself. In wishing for this sort of charismatic adulation for Eunikos, Apellis inadvertently alerts us to the likely presence of women in the Geloan festival audience. The new reading of lines 12-13, proposed by Wilson and Favi 2017, does not quite involve an ‘act of sympathetic magic’ as previously thought. In this case Apellis is likely to have uttered some sort of oral spell, ἐπῳδαί, while writing or burying the tablet. While tablets differ cases by cases, spells which accompanied the ritual were probably formulaic, such as maledictions, invocations of chthonic deities, voces magicae. As a result, if ἐπῳδαί is to be accepted, Εὐχά, at l.1, becomes the preferable reading as curse tablets can present supplicative forms to address the gods. What is striking is that both the sides of the tablet are concerned with τιµή. In the case of the financial transaction on side A, τιµή (the ‘value’ of the cattle, l.5) is the essential matter at stake in the record and, in the curse on side B, the τιµή (honour) is asked to be drawn away from Eunikos’ rivals. This lead tablet, then, seems to be, in Wilson’s word, “more than a handy piece of writing material that had outlived its initial usefulness: it had a proven power to draw τιμή.”\u003C/p>  ",{"id":625,"html":687},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 49.1264 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 53.0994 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 57.0905b \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Miller 1973 134 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002516\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002516\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Brugnone 1980-1981 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001462\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001462\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Masson 1984-1985 75-76 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001466\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001466\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Dubois 1989 no. 134b \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000187\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000187\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Lopez-Jimeno 1991 110-131 no. 17 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001858\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001858\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Jordan 1999 206-215 \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Arena 2002 45 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001373\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001373\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Jordan 2007 335-350 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002301\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002301\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 2007 351-377 \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson and Favi 2017 138-140 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002302\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002302\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Jordan 1985 174 no. 91 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001391\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001391\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Franek and Urbanova 2019 33-34 \u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  ",{"id":689,"html":690},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
