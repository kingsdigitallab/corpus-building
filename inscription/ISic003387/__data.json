Attested examples of both features are discussed in detail in Prag 2017. Relief lettering is not otherwise attested in Sicily (except on a couple of examples of engraved river stones), and the clearest parallels can be found in late Hellenistic funerary epigraphy from western Greece (Corcyra, Ambracia, Apollonia, etc.). Bichrome painted letters are also found in a funerary inscription from Lilybaeum (Marsala) - ISic003662 - but are generally very unusual.

The form Νικασίς is not attested in Sicily itself, but the more common name \u003Ca href=\"http://clas-lgpn2.classics.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/lgpn_search.cgi?region=sicily;namenoaccents=ΝΙΚΑΣΙΩΝ\" target=\"_blank\"> Νικασίων \u003C/a> is well attested in Sicily, with one instance at Adranon, two at Akrai, one at Henna, two at Lipara, and one at Tauromenion. The patronym, \u003Ca href=\"http://clas-lgpn2.classics.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/lgpn_search.cgi?region=sicily;namenoaccents=ΑΡΙΣΤΟΚΡΑΤΗΣ\" target=\"_blank\"> Ἀριστοκράτης\u003C/a>, is extremely common, including ten instances in Sicily.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The use of relief lettering and bichromatic colouring on alternate letters are both extremely rare in classical epigraphy. Attested examples of both features are discussed in detail in Prag 2017. Relief lettering is not otherwise attested in Sicily (except on a couple of examples of engraved river stones), and the clearest parallels can be found in late Hellenistic funerary epigraphy from western Greece (Corcyra, Ambracia, Apollonia, etc.). Bichrome painted letters are also found in a funerary inscription from Lilybaeum (Marsala) - ISic003662 - but are generally very unusual.
