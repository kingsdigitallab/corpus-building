Manni Piraino suggests a date in the early third century BCE, but this seems too early, and a date in the second century is more likely, primarily on palaeographic grounds, but also the general form of the honorific (SEG states third century AD, but this must be an erroneous transcription of the Italian 'a.C.'). If the suggested restoration of line 1 is correct, a significant amount of text is missing from the right, and beside the nomen, filiation, and potential cognomen of the Roman being honoured (the last highly unlikely in a text of the third century BCE), it is likely that a formal magistracy was also mentioned (most Romans honoured in Sicily in this period were office-holders). However, comparable texts from the north coast also exist which only have the words   in the first line. If the omicron at the end of line 2 is correct (impossible to see in the photograph), then Lucius Domitius [-] f. Gn. n. becomes the most likely reading and that would most immediately suggest the praetor in Sicily of probably 97 BCE (Cic. Ver. 5.7 ; V. Max. 6.3.5 ; Quint. Inst. 4.2.17), .
