The exact significance of the term, inevitably depends upon the text's dating, and so as to whether (and when) Centuripe is thought to have municipal status (most recently considered by Korhonen and Soraci 2019: 107, who speculate that this is therefore the earliest attestation of the town's municipal status). However, it is at least as plausible, especially given the entirely standard Greek nomenclature of the dedicant, that this is an instance of linguistic romanisation within a Sicilian Greek civic arrangement, and simply references a member of the local, oligarchic boule on an increasingly Romanised model (cf. the problematic chronology of the financial inscriptions of Taormina, and Roman intervention in several cities' 'constitutions' in this period; general context for the oligarchisation of Republican Sicily and parallel considerations outlined in J.R.W.
