Whether one reads D, P, or R it is difficult to resolve this particular combination as a member of the Julio-Claudian family. It is therefore simpler to assume that the first, larger line contains the name of an honorand in the dative, with the nomen Iulius (either therefore a freedman or a new citizen), and the second line with Divi A[ugusti] perhaps contains a reference, e.g. to flamen divi Augusti, a position attested in Halaesa, both on coinage (RPC I.630-631) and in the epigraphy (cf. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic371\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003571\u003C/a>), and elsewhere in Sicily. It is likely therefore that there is only a single letter missing from the start of line 1 (i.e. the abbreviated praenomen), but if one assumes that the name was centred, and that the second line, which appears slightly more condensed than the first, extended further to the left, then there would be room for \"flamini\" prior to \"divi\". The rest of the text might contain further references to the individual’s career, and a record of the honouring body, such as \"D(ecreto) D(ecurionum)\".\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The reference to divus Augustus gives a terminus post quem of AD 14.
