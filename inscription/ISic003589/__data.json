Whether one reads D, P, or R it is difficult to resolve this particular combination as a member of the Julio-Claudian family. It is therefore simpler to assume that the first, larger line contains the name of an honorand in the dative, with the nomen Iulius (either therefore a freedman or a new citizen), and the second line with Divi A[ugusti] perhaps contains a reference, e.g. to flamen divi Augusti, a position attested in Halaesa, both on coinage (RPC I.630-631) and in the epigraphy (cf. \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic371\" target=\"_blank\">ISic003571\u003C/a>), and elsewhere in Sicily.
