There is, in turn, no obvious parallel in Fazellus for the use of the symbol '7' (in another text, also lost -  -  a symbol comparable to a '6' is however apparently employed to signify a hedera). What is not clear is how Mommsen arrived at the text which he presents in CIL, in which the reversed C is arbitrarily transposed to the beginning of line 2 and/or substituted for the '7'.

Fazellus can be shown, in another surviving text (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000146\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000146\u003C/a>) to have reported such a reversed C correctly, so the transcription here need not be doubted. There is, in turn, no obvious parallel in Fazellus for the use of the symbol '7' (in another text, also lost - \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000119\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000119\u003C/a> - a symbol comparable to a '6' is however apparently employed to signify a hedera). What is not clear is how Mommsen arrived at the text which he presents in CIL, in which the reversed C is arbitrarily transposed to the beginning of line 2 and/or substituted for the '7'. It is also noteworthy that in subsequent editions the numeral is variously presented as XIV and in Gualtherus as XVIII (the latter surely an error of transcription from his source). There is also no material basis for the rectangular form within which Gualtherus places the text.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Fazellus 1558 Decade 1, Liber 9, p.194 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002606\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002606\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 no. 129 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002388\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002388\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 [1625] \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/310971\" target=\"_blank\">no.292\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1769 \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/501422\" target=\"_blank\">p.130, cl.10, no.48\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002084\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Castelli 1784 \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/501841\" target=\"_blank\">p.138, cl.10, no.55\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002083\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/books/CILv10pII1883\" target=\"_blank\">10.7437\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 143 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002137\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1988 50 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\u003C/a>  \u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[508,510,512,514,516,518],{"id":100,"html":509},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"reversed\" title=\"reversed: Ↄ\">(())\u003C/span>SEMPRONIO\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>7LPRIMIONI\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>ANNORUMXIIII\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":438,"html":511},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>Text of Fazellus 1558\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line 1\">Line.1: \u003Cspan>Mommsen: [---]Sempronio\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line 2\">Line.2: \u003Cspan>Mommsen: ((mulieris)) L Primioni\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003Cbr>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line 3\">Line.3: \u003Cspan>Gualtherus 1624, Torremuzza 1769, 1784 (ex Gualt.): XVIII\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>",{"id":452,"html":513},"\u003Ch2> translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":454,"html":515},"\u003Ch2>commentary\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Interpretation of this text (lost) remains extremely problematic. Fazellus is the only authority who may have seen this (it is implied in his account, but not explicit); all subsequent authorities did not. Consequently, subsequent versions of the text posterior to the 1558 edition of Fazellus all appear to be attempts to intepret the text reported in Fazellus. This contains a reversed C prior to Sempronio in line 1; a symbol in the form of the arabic numeral 7 at the beginning of line 2. Other inscriptions from Termini employ a reversed C in a role other than that of the abbreviation for (freedperson of) a woman; however in each case the symbol stands directly before a numeral, and so has reasonably been interpreted to signify 'circiter'; that context does not apply here. Fazellus can be shown, in another surviving text (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000146\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000146\u003C/a>) to have reported such a reversed C correctly, so the transcription here need not be doubted. There is, in turn, no obvious parallel in Fazellus for the use of the symbol '7' (in another text, also lost - \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000119\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000119\u003C/a> - a symbol comparable to a '6' is however apparently employed to signify a hedera). What is not clear is how Mommsen arrived at the text which he presents in CIL, in which the reversed C is arbitrarily transposed to the beginning of line 2 and/or substituted for the '7'. It is also noteworthy that in subsequent editions the numeral is variously presented as XIV and in Gualtherus as XVIII (the latter surely an error of transcription from his source).
