is very plausible. The rest of the text says ‘...of Zeus and...’. A second divinity’s name in the genitive is therefore likely to follow (such as Manganaro's suggestion of Hestia), but it’s not clear what could precede – the main options with the –υς ending are: (1) another genitive singular (many third declension words ending in –ης have a genitive in –ους),  in which case a name or an object are possible, but epithets of Zeus usually follow the name, and one would expect another connective between proper names; (2) a nominative singular in -υς (such as ἱερ]εὺς), or (3) an accusative plural in –ους (in the latter two cases, this would then refer to something of Zeus and ...). But we cannot go much further.",{"_":443,"ref":444},"The letters are very similar to those around the diazoma of the theatre built by Hieron II in Syracuse and which were inscribed after 238 BC, and consist of the names of members of the royal house and divinities (including Διὸς Ὀλυμπίου (.

We could confidently say that they belong to the third century however, and so might reflect work on the fortress by either Agathocles or Hieron II.
