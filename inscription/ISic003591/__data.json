The clear cultural framework of the so-called ‘Second Sophistic’ period, in particular in the act of honouring a rhetor (a teacher and exponent of public speaking), must be assumed to have influenced the choice of language on this occasion, serving to make an explicit statement regarding the high cultural value of Greek. There is no way of knowing whether Petitus was of Halaesan origin, or an individual who had assisted the city in some way.

The nomen Aelius is the most likely, consequent upon the emperor T. Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius (138-161 AD). The final surviving line is most plausibly restored with reference to the polis as the body responsible for the honour, in which case the ethnic would be expected in line 6. It is always possible that additional lines are missing below.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The cognomen Πετειτος = Petitus is not attested in Greek, but finds a number of examples in Latin inscriptions. The name belongs to a group of names particularly common in N. Africa and derived from participles, reflecting the attitude of parents to the child, and particularly that a child was “wished or prayed for”, or he/she was “a gift” (see Kajanto, J. 1965. The Latin Cognomina. Helsinki, at 75-76). The wish is made explicit, with the verb petitus, although outside the onomastic context, in an inscription from Puteoli (\u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/537184\" target=\"_blank\">CIL 10 no.3310 = ILCV 1789\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The phrase ἐγ συνεισφορᾶς is unusual, but easily understood. The compound word συνεισφορᾶς is rare and where attested epigraphically (e.g. \u003Ca href=\"http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/iaph2007/iAph080027.html\" target=\"_blank\">J. Reynolds, Aphrodisias and Rome (1982), no.8 line 42\u003C/a>) tends to refer to a collective taxation arrangement. The use of ἐγ for ἐκ in front of sigma is very unusual. Although the inscription has been linked to the large statue base in opus reticulatum in the agora, and the marble togate statue found in the 18th century and known as the orator (e.g. Scibona, G. 2009b. L'Agorà (scavi 1970-2004). In G. Scibona and G. Tigano (eds), Alaisa-Halaesa. Scavi e ricerche (1970-2007) (Messina: Regione Siciliana) 9-43, at 39), this is without foundation.\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The choice of Greek in an inscription of the high imperial period is noteworthy, since almost all of the other public inscriptions of the imperial period from Halaesa are in Latin (notwithstanding the obvious Greek tradition).
