The name belongs to a group of names particularly common in N. Africa and derived from participles, reflecting the attitude of parents to the child, and particularly that a child was “wished or prayed for”, or he/she was “a gift” (see Kajanto, J. 1965. The Latin Cognomina. Helsinki, at 75-76). The wish is made explicit, with the verb petitus, although outside the onomastic context, in an inscription from Puteoli (\u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/537184\" target=\"_blank\">CIL 10 no.3310 = ILCV 1789\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>  \u003Cp>The phrase ἐγ συνεισφορᾶς is unusual, but easily understood.
