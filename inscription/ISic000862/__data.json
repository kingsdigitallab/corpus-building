correspondents, and in Smet), this inscription was originally part of a large sarcophagus, with columns at the corners; the front bore reliefs of a man and a woman, with the inscription in between and beneath Charon in a boat. In the 16th century it was used for the burial of a bishop, in the church of San Martino, after which it seems to disappear from the record, and the versions in Castelli, CIG and IG 14.45 all derive from the earlier antiquarian record. Subsequently, Orsi recorded a fragment (b) among the material which he catalogued on his arrival at the museum of Siracusa in 1888, recorded as inventory no.135, and which he published in NSA 1889, and which Kaibel reported directly in the addenda to IG 14, at number 59a. Ferrua, writing in 1940, astutely observed that the fragment(b) recorded by Orsi (described in his Taccuini, vol. 1, p.43, and in NSA, as having been found in two pieces in the pavement of the Duomo in Siracusa in 1884) must be the lower left part of this text. Independently of this, Orsi reported another fragmentary text (fragment (a)) found in excavations on via Minerva in 1915 almost at the junction with via Roma (i.e. immediately behind the Duomo), which he published in MAL 1918, and which is now in the archaeological museum with inventory number 37556. It is to the credit of Kalle Korhonen (2002, 78-79 n.21) to have recognised that this second fragment belongs to the first line of this text also. The proximity of the two fragments and the clear reworking for re-use of fragment (a) make their belonging to the same original monument not implausible, although the re-use is at a little distance from the church of San Martino near the southern end of Ortygia. To date, fragment (b), inv.135, has not been located in the museum, but fragment (a), inv. 37556 has been.",{"type":606,"listBibl":607},"bibliography",[608,644],{"type":111,"bibl":609},[610,613,616,619,624,629,632,635,638,641],{"author":114,"date":115,"citedRange":116,"ptr":611,"ref":612},{"target":118},{"_":120,"target":120},{"author":114,"date":124,"citedRange":125,"ptr":614,"ref":615},{"target":127},{"_":129,"target":129},{"type":133,"n":134,"citedRange":135,"ptr":617,"ref":618},{"target":137},{"_":139,"target":139},{"type":133,"n":143,"citedRange":620,"ptr":622,"ref":623},{"ref":621},{"_":146,"target":147},{"target":149},{"_":151,"target":151},{"type":133,"n":143,"citedRange":625,"ptr":627,"ref":628},{"ref":626},{"_":157,"target":147},{"target":149},{"_":151,"target":151},{"type":161,"n":162,"author":163,"title":162,"date":165,"citedRange":166,"ptr":630,"ref":631},{"target":168},{"_":170,"target":170},{"author":173,"date":174,"citedRange":175,"ptr":633,"ref":634},{"target":177},{"_":179,"target":179},{"type":161,"n":183,"citedRange":184,"ptr":636,"ref":637},{"target":186},{"_":188,"target":188},{"author":192,"date":193,"citedRange":194,"ptr":639,"ref":640},{"target":196},{"_":198,"target":198},{"author":202,"date":203,"citedRange":204,"ptr":642,"ref":643},{"target":206},{"_":208,"target":208},{"type":212,"bibl":32},[646,647],{"n":532,"url":91,"height":533,"width":534,"desc":92,"surfaceType":529},{"n":532,"url":542,"height":533,"width":534,"desc":92,"surfaceType":539},{"title":649,"body":650,"divs":651,"images":665},"ISic000862.
