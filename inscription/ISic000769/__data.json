The existence of a Naevius in the Romilia tribe at Sora (CIL 10 no.5742), noted by Scibona, does not by itself provide any necessary support to the suggestion; the Romilia tribe is not otherwise attested in Sicily (Prag 2010). Neither the stone nor the form of interpunct find immediate parallels in the other material from Halaesa. The form of the text and the double cognomen suggest that the text is probably of the second or early third century AD.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 1973.0272 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Scibona 1971 17 no.8 fig.2-3 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001599\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001599\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1988 46 n.225 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1989 190 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001831\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001831\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Facella 2006 212, 294 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Scibona 2008 27 ph \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001593\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001593\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 2012 184 fig.177 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.21 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[517,519,521,523,525,527],{"id":385,"html":518},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>.NA[..].O.\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>FROMFIRMI\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>NOM[.]NI.IANO\u003Cbr id=\"al4\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">4\u003C/span>\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">··\u003C/span>[\u003Cspan dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gap\">········\u003C/span>]\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":429,"html":520},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan>\u003Cspan>text from autopsy\u003C/span>\u003C/span>; \u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cspan class=\"Line 1\">Line.1: \u003Cspan>Manganaro: Ti.

As Prestianni Giallombardo has noted, the lacuna appears rather large for just two letters, but the text is notable at several points for being widely spaced (e.g. ROM and IRM in line 2, MAN in line 3) and the suggestion remains much the most plausible (Scibona’s observation that one would expect to see the edge of the D if reading Nasidio is persuasive against this). The existence of a Naevius in the Romilia tribe at Sora (CIL 10 no.5742), noted by Scibona, does not by itself provide any necessary support to the suggestion; the Romilia tribe is not otherwise attested in Sicily (Prag 2010).
