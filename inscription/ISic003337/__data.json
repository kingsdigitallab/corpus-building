construction of a funerary epigram – much of this text is quasi-verse rather than truly metrical (see Manganaro 1994 for further examples). Linguistically it shows several features which are non-standard, such as the occasional use of epsilon for eta (e.g. Μοίρες for Μοίρης) and multiple cases of iotacism. Manganaro notes that the form Eirena as opposed to Eirene often occurs in a Jewish context and may therefore signify that Eirena was of Jewish origin.
