latina).",{"type":524,"resp":185,"p":525},"commentary","The text offers a good example of a type of funerary inscription that is moderately well-attested in Sicily, mixing verse and prose in the construction of a funerary epigram – much of this text is quasi-verse rather than truly metrical (see Manganaro 1994 for further examples). Linguistically it shows several features which are non-standard, such as the occasional use of epsilon for eta (e.g. Μοίρες for Μοίρης) and multiple cases of iotacism. Manganaro notes that the form Eirena as opposed to Eirene often occurs in a Jewish context and may therefore signify that Eirena was of Jewish origin. At the same time, the christograms in the final line make it clear that her husband was Christian. The interpretation of Βωτιβοῖο in the final line is debated. Manganaro suggests that this is two words in the dative: the relatively rare name Βῶτις followed by the rarer ethnic Βοῖος, signifying either Pannonian, or more likely from a region of western Gaul near Bordeaux (and he notes evidence for various links between Gaul and Sicily in the Imperial period, suggesting therefore that Botis was a Gallic trader). Perrin (in AE 2006 no.514) suggests that this is instead a single word, ending in a Homeric genitive form (-οιο), and is a transliteration of the Latin name Votivus (and so ‘beloved of Votivus’, rather than ‘most dear to Botis the Boian’). The tombs of the necropolis are dated to the late fourth and fifth century AD and the inscription easily fits within this date range (Tigano, G. 2008. Le necropoli. In G. Scibona and G. Tigano (eds), Alesa Archonidea.

Manganaro suggests that this is two words in the dative: the relatively rare name Βῶτις followed by the rarer ethnic Βοῖος, signifying either Pannonian, or more likely from a region of western Gaul near Bordeaux (and he notes evidence for various links between Gaul and Sicily in the Imperial period, suggesting therefore that Botis was a Gallic trader). Perrin (in AE 2006 no.514) suggests that this is instead a single word, ending in a Homeric genitive form (-οιο), and is a transliteration of the Latin name Votivus (and so ‘beloved of Votivus’, rather than ‘most dear to Botis the Boian’).
