The lettering of this text is both larger and cruder than on the companion text, and less carefully set out, suggesting a different hand.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":407,"html":433},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Bacci and Coppolino 2009 28 fig.15 (and ref on p.113) \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002171\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002171\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Sofia 2018 107 no.6 and fig.7 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001574\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001574\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":435,"html":436},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
