The implication is that Euphrosyne was his second wife, who outlived him. The use of Latin numerals in the middle of the Greek text is a clear indication of the co-existence of the two languages in Catania at this date and the ‘interference’ between them (just as the name Cornelius Agathemeros combines Latin and Greek names also).\u003C/p>  ",{"id":395,"html":443},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0485\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 73 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 3.5695 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":445,"html":446},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
