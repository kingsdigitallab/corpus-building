The Athenians [erected this].",{"type":583,"resp":100,"p":584},"commentary",{"_":585,"ref":586,"foreign":593},"It is extremely likely that this base is dedicated to the same Pollienus as . Here, only his position as tribunus militum is recorded. If correct, this Pollienus is Cn. Pollienus Cn. f. tribunus militum of the 12th Fulminata legion. While it is likely that Pollienus settled in Thermae Himeraeae after it was made a colonia, Bivona (1994, 126) and Wilson (1990, 38-39) disagree as to whether Pollienus was at the beginning of his career, or a soldier of proven experience. Bivona and Wilson equally disagree as to whether veterans of Legio XII Fulminata were sent to Thermae Himeraeae at the foundation of the colony. Our Pollienus could be the son of Gnaeus Pollienus (rendered in Greek) at Haluntium , although the recent reconsideration of that inscription by Korhonen and Soraci (2019, 103-106) suggest that both men might be one and the same. Mommsen suggested a sizeable lacuna to the left of [A]thenienses and that this should be restored as '', i.e. erected by Roman citizens resident in Athens, together with the Athenians (in order to explain the use of Latin by Athenians). Bivona (1994, 127) accepts this restoration. Korhonen and Soraci (2019, 105 n.51) suggest that this is unnecessary with the dimensions of the stone, and question Mommsen's reasoning that the Athenians would not dedicate in Latin; and while that reasoning must remain uncertain, the spacing seems to support their reading. Given that the letters '' are presumably missing at the end of line 1, the text is not far off symmetrical even with only '' in line 3. Bivona (1994, 127) rightly rejects Manganaro's (1988, 42) suggestion of '' as this ignores what is clearly visible in line 3 and has no justification. It is unclear why Athenians should dedicate a base to Pollienus, but perhaps relates to activities during the civil wars.
