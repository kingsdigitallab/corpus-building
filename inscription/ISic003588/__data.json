Roman Imperial Titulature and Chronology, A.D. 235-284. Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben, at 277-280 for titulature). Given this identification, the most plausible interpretation of the letters BEL (note absence of interpunct after the L, suggesting this is not the end of the word), would seem to be the name Veldumnianus, which follows the name Gallus in most dedications to this emperor. Variant renderings of this presumably unfamiliar (in Sicily) name are fairly common (e.g. \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/194304\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1953 no.12\u003C/a>, Uldum[nia]no, \u003Ca href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/328303\" target=\"_blank\">CIL 8 no.22465\u003C/a>, Voldumiano), but in this case we have an example of the very standard confusion of B and V. The substitution of B for V is more common generally in intervocalic positions, but well attested, particularly in Rome and southern Italy, in the initial position also (see Adams, J. 2007. The Regional Diversification of Latin 200 BC - AD 600. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, at 624-666).
