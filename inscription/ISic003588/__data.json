about 50% of its width, since the first part of the standard titulature of the emperor Volusianus is Imperator Caesar Caius Vibius Afinius (June 251-October 253 AD; see Peachin, M. 1990. Roman Imperial Titulature and Chronology, A.D. 235-284. Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben, at 277-280 for titulature). Given this identification, the most plausible interpretation of the letters BEL (note absence of interpunct after the L, suggesting this is not the end of the word), would seem to be the name Veldumnianus, which follows the name Gallus in most dedications to this emperor. Variant renderings of this presumably unfamiliar (in Sicily) name are fairly common (e.g. , Uldum[nia]no, , Voldumiano), but in this case we have an example of the very standard confusion of B and V. The substitution of B for V is more common generally in intervocalic positions, but well attested, particularly in Rome and southern Italy, in the initial position also (see Adams, J. 2007. The Regional Diversification of Latin 200 BC - AD 600. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, at 624-666).
