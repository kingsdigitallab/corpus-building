The burials were contained in two clay sarcophagi. The vessels found in the tomb can be divided into two groups (Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, 194): large Attic (imported) drinking vessels (cups, 'stemless cups', a skyphos, i.e. luxury vessels, typically related to the consumption of wine in the symposium); vessels of different types, all of a smaller size. To the first group belong 7 vases in total, of which 3 belong to the deceased in the front of the chamber, 4 to the second, in the back. The inscriptions of this first group show what appear to be names, perhaps onomastic formulae, followed by an ending in -mi, that could be (cf. Agostiniani, in Agostiniani, Albanese Procelli 2018, p. 195) an aphaeretic form of the verb εἰμί, not known in Greek epigraphic culture but perhaps adapted by the writers of Montagna di Marzo in correspondence with syntactic structures proper to their language. The vessel in question is part of the later deposition and has two inscriptions by two different hands, as shown by the difference in the ductus and the different dimensions of the letters. The first engraver writes 'Ιταλο', genitive of Ιταλος, while the second engraver writes towards the centre of the vase 'αρακακαμι', using the supposed ownership formula. An identical situation, albeit with different ductus occurs in two other cups from the same deposition, the first with the names Italos/ara kaka-mi (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020743\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020743\u003C/a>), the second with Ratora arakakami (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic020745\" target=\"_blank\">ISic020745\u003C/a>). The use of different type of alphas, even in the same inscription (αρακακαμι) is still being discussed. The use of the arrow-shaped alpha, in general, has long been attributed the intention of the 'Sikels' to mark their alphabet in contrast with the alphabet used by the Greeks. One might rather link this use with the spread of a particular variety of alpha among the Sikel workshops, which later became characteristic of their alphabet, or with the desire to differentiate phonemes perceived as akin but not identical (as might perhaps also be the case in the Elymian texts, for example, with the alternation of beta used both in the Selinus 'reversed nu' type and in the 'regular' type; cf. Agostiniani 1977, p. 119-120, 4.2.1). For a further discussion on the spread of the arrow-shaped alpha in Sicily see \u003Ca href=\"http://zotero.org/groups/382445/items/JCF4E489\" target=\"_blank\">Tribulato, Mignosa 2021\u003C/a>. According to Agostiniani (2018, 196) Ἰταλός and ῾Ρατορας are two sodales of the warrior of the later deposition, who had written their names on the cups they used and then dedicated them to the deceased in the funerary ceremony. According to the editor, the names may also indicate that they are not Greeks, even though the morphology used here (the genitive rather than the aferetic formula -emi) is certainly Greek.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Agostiniani Forthcoming MMA?? \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002519\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Mussinano 1970 no. 8, p. 176, pl.
