Contra Bivona (1994), but I read 'MILTAVIT' on stone, rather than 'MIITAVIT'.

Although there is some uncertainty, given the condition of the front face of the inscription, it appears that line 4 reads 'victoria Liciniana' (following the reading of Manganaro (1989)), who subsequently dated the inscription to a victoria Liciniana of Licinius, either in 310 or 313 CE, either in Raetia or at Campus Egrenus in Thrace.
