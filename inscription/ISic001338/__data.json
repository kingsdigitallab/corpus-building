Bella'. The form of the text, including the line above the first three letters, is identical to the second and third lines of \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001404\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001404\u003C/a>, preserved in Adrano museum, and from the right bank of the Simeto river (see that text for further commentary). The spacing in the text of Gualtherus, and the presence of the line above the first three letters, encourages the idea that the text was on a boundary stone, in large letters, divided over two lines, as in the case of the Adrano stone. A second, very similar text (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004424\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004424\u003C/a>) was recorded by Gualtherus, and both are repeated in CIG and IG. Manganaro (1994) briefly discusses these texts, and argues that they should be considered distinct from the set of texts preserved in the manuscript collection of Gaetano Marini, from Sferri, in the territory of Paterno, and reproduced by several scholars, including \u003Ca href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/items/759ZXHKQ\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrua 1989\u003C/a>, p. 123-124 nr. 471 (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004425\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004425\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004426\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004426\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004427\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004427\u003C/a>); the second and third of those texts (ISic004426 and ISic004427) are similar to this one, but seemingly not identical. The only text actually preserved is ISic001404 in Adrano museum.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":413,"html":450},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Gualtherus 1624 [1625] 9 no.56 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001931\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6873760\" target=\"_blank\">14.0518\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001072\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 45.1353 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000796\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 3.5733 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001252\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1994 173-174 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001823\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":452,"html":453},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
