The extent of the stone that is lost is unknown. The erection of posthumous honours or funerary monuments in accordance with a will is a common practice (a Sicilian example from Catania in \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000380\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000380\u003C/a>). It is possible that \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000768\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000768\u003C/a> (dedication to Concordia by a sevir) was set up by the same Aulus Mevius Zethus, or a related individual, since the cognomen [-]ethus is preserved there. The gens Mevius is also attested at Taormina \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000282\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000282\u003C/a> and at Termini (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000198\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000198\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000199\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000199\u003C/a>); cf. Facella 2008: 288. The form of this text suggests a date in the first or second century AD.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":391,"html":452},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> 1989.0345f \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001283\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1989 190 no.80 fig.86 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001831\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001831\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Facella 2006 288 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002013\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prestianni Giallombardo 2012 194 n.112 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001357\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Prag and Tigano 2017 no.48 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002630\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":454,"html":455},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
