In contrast to #4, there is a small amount of\n                                        blank space above and below the winged victory. As with the Egadi 4 ram, the\n                                        inscription is moulded and cast, constituting part of the original casting of\n                                        the ram along with the relief decoration.

The second O is incomplete,\n                                    as its base projected over the edge of the cowl face and was cut off in the making\n                                    of the mould.

Likewise the letter forms are suggestive\n                    of a mid-Republican date (third or early second century BC).","M. Publicius L. f. L. n. Malleolus (RE 22) was consul in 232 BC. The omission of the cognomen is\n                    unremarkable. Although we know of a number of other Publicii in this period, no other M. Publicius\n                    L. f. is attested, and only a dozen Publicii in total are attested holding office under the\n                    Republic; a small number of other holders of the name is also known (notably, an M. Populicios M. f.\n                    in a third-century dedication from the Tiber island). We know from literary sources that the consul\n                    of 232 also held the aedileship alongside his brother L. Publicius in either 241 or 238 BC. The date\n                    provides a terminus ante quem for his quaestorship, but greater precision is difficult. It was\n                    normal for a year to intervene between the holding of magistracies, even at this relatively early\n                    date, but the evidence is almost non-existent for the lesser magistracies such as the quaestorship.\n                    There is no basis for reconstructing a ‘standard’ cursus in this period, as the praetorship was not\n                    yet a standard step in the cursus (the second praetorship was only instituted c. 242 BC), and the\n                    aedileship was never compulsory. Third-century evidence for the place of the quaestorship in the\n                    cursus is negligible. In the second century we know of 18 individuals whose quaestorship can be\n                    dated (sometimes only approximately) and who went on to hold the consulship. In three cases the\n                    interval was, or may have been, less than 10 years. Attested intervals otherwise range from 12 to 21\n                    years, with 7 cases of 12-14 years and 8 cases of 16-21 years. It is therefore most likely that the\n                    consul of 232 BC held his quaestorship some time in the 240s, and possible that he held it as early\n                    as the late 250s. In this respect, it is relevant to consider that one plausible explanation for the\n                    presence of mostly Roman/Latin inscribed rostra on the sea-bed, at the site of what was a Roman\n                    victory, is that the rams were all from Roman ships previously captured by the Carthaginians in\n                    earlier battles (in particular at the battle of Drepanum in 249 BC, when the Carthaginians seized 93\n                    Roman ships and took them back to Carthage (Polyb. 1.51.12, 53.1)); those ships and rams would then\n                    have been in reuse by the Carthaginians as part of their emergency resupply fleet of 241 BC which\n                    was sunk by the Romans at the Egadi islands. If that explanation holds truth (and it is attractive\n                    for several reasons), then in order to identify the quaestor Publicius of Egadi 4, 6, and 11 with\n                    the consul of 232 BC we require a gap of at least 17 years between quaestorship and consulship,\n                    since the construction round which he supervised would have to have been in 250/49 BC at the latest,\n                    and not that for the new Roman fleet of 242/1 BC. As we have seen, such an interval does find\n                    parallels in the second century, and should therefore be entertained as a possibility. Further\n                    support for this possibility comes from the fact that Publicius, as the plebeian consul of 232 BC,\n                    was the only member of his family ever to reach the consulship, and therefore a significant delay in\n                    his reaching the top of the cursus is by no means out of the question. The identification of course\n                    cannot be proven, however likely it may seem.","C. Papirius Ti. f. cannot be identified. The family of the Papirii (branches bearing the cognomina\n                    Cursor and Crassus) held high office in the early Republic, and in the third century the Papirii\n                    Masones came to prominence, including the consul of 231 BC, C. Papirius C. f. L. n. Maso (RE 57);\n                    several other branches of the family are also attested, including the Carbones of the later\n                    Republic.
