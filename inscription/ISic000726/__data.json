Manganaro also misreports the inventory number (giving 33617 instead of 38617). Manganaro proposes restoring as a dedication to Trajan as proconsul during the Parthian campaign in 116 CE, on the model of  ILS 301. This is plausible, but hardly certain. The title of proconsul for an emperor absent from the city on campaign is most frequently attested for the emperors of the last second / early third century CE. Perhaps of more immediate relevance is the likely extent of the missing lacuna on the right. Unless the text was extremely wide, Trajan perhaps offers the best opportunities among those with the epithet for a relatively short form of his name prior to the epithet Germanicus (compare, e.g., a dedication from Corinth (, or one from Egypt, CIL 3.14147.2 / ).
