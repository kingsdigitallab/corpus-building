The state of preservation of this fragment is different from that of the other Latin fragment, and from the limited evidence available the letter forms appear different also; although found in the same location, the two fragments are reported form different later, mediaeval, layers. It is plausible to assume that they are fragments of two separate public documents originally displayed somewhere in the agora in the Roman period. The (X?)XX with supraline presumably records a numeral, potentially a monetary sum, of 20,000+, although a board of magistrates (XXvirate or similar) is perhaps not inconceivable (but even less likely the moment the numeral is more than 20), the supraline being used to mark such numerical abbreviations of magistrate names also.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":407,"html":436},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Isler 1995 20 with 37 n.11 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002488\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002488\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Isler 1996 54 n.8 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002489\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002489\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Isler 2012 234 with n.41 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001361\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001361\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  ",{"id":438,"html":439},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence ",[441,443],{"image":94,"thumb":442,"title":95},"ISic030049_tiled-thumb.tif",{"image":359,"thumb":444,"title":95},"ISic030049-thumb.jpg"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
