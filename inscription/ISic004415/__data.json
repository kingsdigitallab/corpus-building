This plinth is one of a pair on a single base - a type attested several times in this necropolis - and the second plinth (\u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004416\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004416\u003C/a>) is also inscribed and appears also to bear the name Αυνακος in the genitive as its second element, suggesting that the tomb is a double one for siblings. The same situation seems to be attested in the case of \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004417\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004417\u003C/a> / \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic004418\" target=\"_blank\">ISic004418\u003C/a>. The first name here appears to be in the nominative (which has a parallel in \u003Ca href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic001208\" target=\"_blank\">ISic001208\u003C/a>), rather than the more commonly found genitive in this necropolis.\u003C/p>  ",{"id":402,"html":429},"\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli> Bacci and Coppolino 2009 28 fig.15 (and ref on p.113) \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002171\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10002171\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Sofia 2018 107 no.5 and fig.6 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001574\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001574\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  ",{"id":431,"html":432},"license"," Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.
