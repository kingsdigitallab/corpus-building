Quintus Atilius is presumably a member of the equestrian order, having held the military office in the imperial legions of praefectus fabrum (literally \"prefect of the craftsmen/engineers\": the precise role of the post is not entirely clear). Atilius also held the chief magistracy of the colonia, the duumvirate (a pair of annually appointed magistrates). The record of appointment by vote of the people is unusual: explicit statements to this effect are rare, with the result that, although in theory all such appointments were by popular vote, many historians (e.g. Mommsen and Liebenam) have concluded that under the empire it was more common for the appointments effectively to be made by co-option by the decuriones (town councillors), and a formal popular vote therefore constituted an honour, whence the choice to record it explicitly as here. Both the Claudia and the Quirina tribes (formal divisions of Roman citizens) are attested at Catania.\u003C/p>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"bibliography\">\u003Ch2>bibliography\u003C/h2>  \u003Cul>  \u003Cli>  \u003Ca href=\"http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/buchseite/650757\" target=\"_blank\">10.7023\u003C/a>  \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000589\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 17 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000028\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> 6771 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000352\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10000352\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Asheri 1982-1983 464 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001372\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001372\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Manganaro 1988 53 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001427\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003Cli> Wilson 1990 359 n.60 \u003Ca href=\"https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001509\" target=\"_blank\">https://biblio.inscriptiones.org/epig10001509\u003C/a>\u003C/li>  \u003C/ul>  \u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>  \u003C/div>  \u003Cdiv id=\"license\"> Licensed under a Creative Commons-Attribution 4.0 licence.  \u003C/div>",[498,500,502,504,506,508,510],{"id":349,"html":499},"\u003Cdiv class=\"textpart\" lang=\"la\">\u003Cspan class=\"ab\" id=\"div\">\u003Ca id=\"al1\">\u003C!--0-->\u003C/a>\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">1\u003C/span>DMS\u003Cbr id=\"al2\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">2\u003C/span>QATILIOQF\u003Cbr id=\"al3\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">3\u003C/span>CLASEVERO\u003Cbr id=\"al4\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">4\u003C/span>PRAEFFABR\u003Cbr id=\"al5\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">5\u003C/span>\u003Cspan class=\"supraline\" title=\"line above\">II\u003C/span>VIRSUF\u003Cbr id=\"al6\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">6\u003C/span>POPULCRE\u003Cbr id=\"al7\">\u003Cspan class=\"linenumber\">7\u003C/span>ATO\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\u003Cp class=\"miniapp\">\u003C/p>",{"id":427,"html":501},"\u003Ch4>Apparatus criticus\u003C/h4>\u003Cp>  \u003C/p>\u003Cp>  \u003C/p>",{"id":429,"html":503},"\u003Ch2>English translation\u003C/h2>  \u003Cp>Sacred to the shades of the underworld.
