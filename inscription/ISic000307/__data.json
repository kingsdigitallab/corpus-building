Quintus Atilius is\n                    presumably a member of the equestrian order, having held the military office in the imperial legions\n                    of praefectus fabrum (literally \"prefect of the craftsmen/engineers\": the precise role of the post\n                    is not entirely clear). Atilius also held the chief magistracy of the colonia, the duumvirate (a\n                    pair of annually appointed magistrates). The record of appointment by vote of the people is unusual:\n                    explicit statements to this effect are rare, with the result that, although in theory all such\n                    appointments were by popular vote, many historians (e.g. Mommsen and Liebenam) have concluded that\n                    under the empire it was more common for the appointments effectively to be made by co-option by the\n                    decuriones (town councillors), and a formal popular vote therefore constituted an honour, whence the\n                    choice to record it explicitly as here.
