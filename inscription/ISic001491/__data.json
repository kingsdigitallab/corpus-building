inscription, which he concluded was on a much eroded outcrop of natural rock, perhaps part of an extra-mural sanctuary. The text is damaged on the left, but from the surviving photograph it is difficult to confirm all aspects of Orsi's reading, such as whether the vacat at the end of line 2 is certain (e.g. Manganaro believed he could see another letter in the photograph after ΔΑΜ), and this has encouraged speculation on the likely expansion or restoration of those letters. It is notable that most later editors seem to have ignored the fact that the left margin is not necessarily the original one. Guarducci and others have speculated on line 1 as a personal name, that of the dedicant, if line two is to be restored/expanded as the dative of the divinity Demeter; the alternative, assuming nothing is missing from the left, is that it stands for 'chief (magistrate)' (so Masson). This latter reading in turn tends to take line 2 as referring to an association of worshippers of Demeter (so first Vollgraff), a group of Damatriastes. The interpretation of line 3 (clearly the genitive plural ethnic of the people of Enna) depends in turn on the alternatives proposed for lines 1 and 2, so variously Demeter of the Ennaians or by/on behalf of the Ennaians (both suggested by Guarducci), or the Demeter association of the people of Enna. Notwithstanding the multiple attestations of the cult of Demeter/Ceres at Enna, such asn association is not otherwise attested and is a hypothetical restoration in this text. Any resolution of the reading must depend upon the possibility of fresh study of the stone, if it can be located (Manganaro speculated that it may have been damaged during the Second World War).","The letter forms, as Guarducci noted, seem to place this text in the early part of the Hellenistic period, rather than later. The use of the aspirate, which would certainly speak to an earlier date, is paralleled in the earlier coinage of Enna, but we remain agnostic, without autopsy, of the presence of the sign on the stone (which Orsi believed to be present, followed by Guarducci).",{"type":457,"listBibl":458},"bibliography",[459,490],{"type":104,"bibl":460},[461,464,467,472,475,478,481,484,487],{"type":107,"n":108,"citedRange":109,"ptr":462,"ref":463},{"target":111},{"_":113,"target":113},{"type":107,"n":108,"citedRange":115,"ptr":465,"ref":466},{"target":111},{"_":113,"target":113},{"type":119,"n":120,"citedRange":468,"ptr":470,"ref":471},{"ref":469},{"_":123,"target":124},{"target":126},{"_":128,"target":128},{"type":107,"n":130,"author":131,"title":130,"date":88,"citedRange":132,"ptr":473,"ref":474},{"target":134},{"_":136,"target":136},{"type":107,"n":130,"author":138,"title":130,"date":88,"citedRange":139,"ptr":476,"ref":477},{"target":134},{"_":136,"target":136},{"author":143,"date":144,"citedRange":145,"ptr":479,"ref":480},{"target":147},{"_":149,"target":149},{"author":151,"date":152,"citedRange":153,"ptr":482,"ref":483},{"target":155},{"_":157,"target":157},{"author":159,"date":160,"citedRange":161,"ptr":485,"ref":486},{"target":163},{"_":165,"target":165},{"author":151,"date":167,"citedRange":168,"ptr":488,"ref":489},{"target":170},{"_":172,"target":172},{"type":174,"bibl":99},[492],{"n":400,"url":95,"height":401,"width":402,"desc":96,"surfaceType":397},{"title":494,"body":495,"divs":496,"images":510},"ISic001491.

It is notable that most later editors seem to have ignored the fact that the left margin is not necessarily the original one. Guarducci and others have speculated on line 1 as a personal name, that of the dedicant, if line two is to be restored/expanded as the dative of the divinity Demeter; the alternative, assuming nothing is missing from the left, is that it stands for 'chief (magistrate)' (so Masson). This latter reading in turn tends to take line 2 as referring to an association of worshippers of Demeter (so first Vollgraff), a group of Damatriastes. The interpretation of line 3 (clearly the genitive plural ethnic of the people of Enna) depends in turn on the alternatives proposed for lines 1 and 2, so variously Demeter of the Ennaians or by/on behalf of the Ennaians (both suggested by Guarducci), or the Demeter association of the people of Enna. Notwithstanding the multiple attestations of the cult of Demeter/Ceres at Enna, such asn association is not otherwise attested and is a hypothetical restoration in this text.
