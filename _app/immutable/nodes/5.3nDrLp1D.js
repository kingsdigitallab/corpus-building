across the whole of antiquity, beginning with the first written texts at the end
of the seventh century BCE, and continuing through to the Byzantine period (currently
with an approximate upper limit of the seventh century CE). The project began with a
focus on texts on stone, and with an initial emphasis on the metadata (bibliography
and information about the inscription, such as material, language and inscription
type). Coverage has steadily expanded to include over 4,500 inscriptions, primarily
on stone, some fully edited, most in draft. We are currently adding the remaining
c.1,000 texts on stone (primarily material from the Syracuse museum and catacombs),
and have started to incorporate texts on metal, ceramic and other instrumentum
domesticum (portable objects). We plan to incorporate texts that were stamped onto
brick and tile, and coin legends.</p> <p>I.Sicily employs the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/" rel="nofollow">EpiDoc TEI-XML standard</a>.
We use this to encode all the information about the inscription and the inscribed
object, as well as the actual text itself: we create a full edition of the
inscription, but directly encoded in EpiDoc, which enables processing of all the
information. These individual editions are published as HTML pages but can also be
searched and filtered through the website, as well as being freely available for
download. We also present high resolution images where available, and publish
bibliography (in <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/382445/isicily/library" rel="nofollow">Zotero</a>)
and collection information through a database of <a href="http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/museums" rel="nofollow">Sicilian museums</a>.
Data is standardised and made potentially interopable by means of the use of
recognised vocabularies, such as the [Pleiades gazetteer of ancient
