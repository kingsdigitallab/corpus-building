Amsterdam: J.C. Gieben), and the omission of the word filius would be unusual (it is unusual to delay it to the end of the full name of the father as must be the case here, but parallels can be cited, such as <a href=\"http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/IRT048.html\" target=\"_blank\">IRT no.48</a>). It is, however, impossible to know how many lines are lost in the lacuna, and how standard or not this text may have been, given that some variation from the most common parallels is already visible, such as the omission of Caesar from the title of Philippus (pater) in line 4 (but see e.g. <a href=\"www.trismegistos.org/text/190683\" target=\"_blank\">AE 1981 no.743</a>). On the other hand, it is unlikely that much more than the rest of the basic nomenclature of Philippus is missing. It is difficult to restore letters to the sequence of letter feet preserved at the start of the preserved line 6, but they are not incompatible with the titolature just noted, and the letters FIL would fit particularly well. The final letter on line 7 is clearly a D, and is clearly centred from the left margin, and so is most obviously compatible with the standard formula D(ecreto) D(ecurionum) of a public honorific. Links between Philippus the elder and the élite of the island are perhaps suggested by the fact that his fellow consul of 245 AD, C. Maesius Aquillius Fabius Titianus was a citizen of Thermae (<a href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000092\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000092</a> and <a href=\"http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscription/ISic000093\" target=\"_blank\">ISic000093</a> honour him and his son).</p>  <p>This text belongs between August 244 and August 247 AD (M.
