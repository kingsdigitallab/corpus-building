Two fragments join to preserve part of the left margin; seven fragments join to preserve part of the upper and right margin, including the upper right corner; the lower margin is not preserved. The total width of the preserved fragments is 86cm, therefore the original total width was greater; the maximum preserved height is 35cm (so the total height was greater); thickness is 3 cm.",
