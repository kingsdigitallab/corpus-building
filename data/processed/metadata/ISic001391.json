    "lettering": "The text is engraved in large bold letters, with the topmost stroke often extended vertically above the letter on Α, Λ, Δ. Letter forms are somewhat variable within the inscription, with lunate and straight sigma used indiscriminately; epsilon is normally straight, but appears lunate in ΦΗϹΕΙΝΟϹ in line 2; alpha is normally straight but displays broken bar in ΕΥΦΡΑΝΘΗΣΑΝ in line 3; phi has an angular eye in lines 1 and 2 but a rounded eye in line 3; variation within texts is however common, and it is not necessary to assume that this reflects different hands in use within the text. Ligatures are employed several times in the text, which has been the source of several confused readings in the past.",
