  "support": "A substantial square base of Taormina limestone (although discoloured, it appears to be the typical pinkish stone of Taormina). The stone is intact, with all faces finished smooth (except the underside, which is squared off but left rough). There is a slight lip or moulding along the upper edge of the right side. There is minor damage to the rear lower left and right corners. Traces of white plaster (deriving from the covering of the bases by a new level of pavement in the restructuring of the early phase of the Roman colonia in the late C1 BCE or very early C1 CE) are visible on all sides, particularly the front face where it partially obscures the text. The top of the stone has two foot-holes on top, front right and rear left, each consisting of a pair of deep (5-6.5 cm deep) roughly circular hollows within the overall foothole, presumably for a bronze statue of a standing figure. The front foot is c.5.5 cm from the front of the stone and 11-12 from the right edge; the rear c.6 cm from the rear of the stone, and 9-17 from the left side.",
