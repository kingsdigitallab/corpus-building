For the fullest discussion, see Ampolo 2021, esp. 91-93. Ampolo, Magnetto and Porciani 2001 demonstrate that the 8 tablets were preserved for an extended period in a single location, superimposed upon one another, probably in a container (a stone theka?), and were most likely found together also. Although reported, investigated, and published multiple times, the tablet remains unrecovered and in private hands.",
