  "support": "A large rectangular block of stone, intact above, and possibly below, but broken on right; perhaps only lightly damaged on left. Previously broken into three pieces, but reconnected. The front face is made up of three horizontal bands, of approximately equal height. The uppermost (18.5-19.5 cm high) is rough finished and uneven, and in places overhangs the middle field, while at other points is shallower; the middle band (17 cm high) is smooth finished and mostly proud of both the upper and lower field, and carries the inscription; the lower band (16.5 cm high) is recessed in relation to the middle band, smooth at the left and right ends, but heavily eroded across much of the width of the stone. The overall thickness of the stone is somewhat variable.",
