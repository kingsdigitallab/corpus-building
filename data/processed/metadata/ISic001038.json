  "support": "A stele of pale white local limestone, broken into three blocks that have been mounted on a modern base and reconnected with modern mortar. There are gaps in the text between each block, and it seems certain that more was preserved at the breaks when the stone was transcribed by Judica than is preserved today. Block 1 (the top block) is intact at the top, front and on both sides, but is broken or cut back at the rear (width 39.5 cm, max height 41.2 cm, max depth 29.5 cm). There is a deep rectangular hole (4x10cm and 10cm deep) at the middle rear of the top surface, perhaps for a clamp? The top is finished, but not smooth. The Sides and front are finished smooth. The front edges on left and right sides are cut back at an angle. Block 2 (middle block) is intact at the front and sides, but sawn straight at the back, proabbly not original; the lower edge is uneven and broken (width 40cm, max height 28 cm, depth 34.2 cm). Block 3 (lowest) is intact on the fornt and sides, broken across the top, at the rear and below (width 41 cm, max Height 46.5 cm, max depth 27.5 cm)",
