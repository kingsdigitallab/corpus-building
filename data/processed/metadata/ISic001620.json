Gualtherus, the front left-hand corner of the stone had been cut away. The right-hand edge of the stone was cut away at some later date. The inscription was rediscovered in 1755 and mentioned by Caio Domenico Gallo. It was found again at the beginning of the twentieth century, built into a wall at Via CÃ¡rdines 152, and was moved to the Museo Regionale di Messina in 1909. For more information on the history of the discovery of the inscription, see Crawford (2011) and Crawford ().",
