The Latin letters show the beginnings of the move towards cursive forms: M has extended upper strokes and the midpoint reaches to the bottom of the line; A also has extended upper stroke and lacks a cross-bar; O is rounded, in contrast to the Greek text, as is Q with extended tail; P is open; R is closed; E has short upward slanting strokes; L has a long foot, forming almost a C.",
