  "support": "Upper left part of a rectangular stele, broken across the middle in two (joining) pieces. The stele is cleanly cut on the right, finished and intact on the left side and on top, broken off below; the rear is roughly worked and uneven. The upper part of the stele is marked off by a moulding, which extends around the left side also (but not the rear). Above the moulding on the front is relief decoration in the form of (the left side of) a winged altar; above this the front face is missing to a depth of several centimetres. The upper fragment (A) is max H. 32.3,  W 8 cm, D 16.6cm at top and 18.1 cm at bottom; the lower fragment (B) is max H 31.4 cm, W 8 cm, D 16.8 cm (top) to 18.2 cm (bottom).",

A horizontal stroke is visible above and the left of the first letter of lines 6 and 26.",
