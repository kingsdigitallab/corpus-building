  "support": "Large quadrangular block of offwhite limestone, in the form of a base. Intact on all sides, but extensive minor damage to the exposed edges. The base is finished smooth. A modern spike projects from the base, presumably for an earlier display mounting. The front face is recessed , with a projecting moulding across top and bottom, and the inscription filling the recessed face. The recessed face, with mouldings above and below, is continued onto the front half of each of the left and right sides (to a depth of 19.5 cm on the left, 19 cm on the right); the rear portion of each side of the block returns to the 'original' surface level, and is only roughly picked flat, implying that the block was inserted into a wall or monument, projecting out for only half its depth. The top is flat, with a central panel front to back that is smooth (c.30 cm wide); the right side of the top is slightly lower front to back and also smooth, while the left portion is more roughly finished. There are no indications of fixing holes of any sort on the upper surface.",
