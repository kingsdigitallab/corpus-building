The accompanying boards set the objects into a clear historical context. One of the highlights of the collection is the aforementioned warship ram. Two other objects given prominence are two of the four Oscan inscriptions in the collection, from the time of Mamertine domination. The principle display cases focus on the cemeteries and religious areas of the city. The grounds of the museum contain a number of monuments and architectural pieces (many from the post-medieval city that was destroyed in the 1908 earthquake) but some earlier as well, principally Roman in date",
