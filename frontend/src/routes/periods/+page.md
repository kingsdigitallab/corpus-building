# Chronological periods in Sicily and I.Sicily

All files in _I.Sicily_ include information on the dating of the inscription (even if very approximate and broadly defined). That information is provided in two ways: a numerical range and a free-text description. The free-text description may reference a time period (e.g. 'Hellenistic'), but these have not so far been systematically employed. However, we aim to make it possible to search by time period by aligning the numerical ranges to pre-defined time-periods.<br/>
However, defining those time periods is far from straightforward. There is a set of more or less canonical historical time periods defined for the Greco-Roman world:<br/>
For the Greek world, these are, traditionally:
* Archaic (776 - 480 BCE)
* Classical (480 - 323 BCE)
* Hellenistic (323 - 31 BCE)
For the Roman world, these might be:
* Roman Republic (509 - 27 BCE)
  *  Early Republic (509 - 287 BCE)
  *  Middle Republic (287 - 133 BCE)
  *  Late Republic (133-49 BCE)
  *  Civil war period (49 - 27 BCE)
* Roman Empire (27 BCE - 641 CE)
  * High Empire (27 BCE - 284 CE)
  * Later Roman Empire / Late Antiquity (284 - 641 CE)
(this last period could be further subdivided, e.g. with the fall of Rome and the western empire in 476 CE).

These periods are all defined by various key historical events (776 BCE the first Olympic Games, 323 BCE the death of Alexander the Great, 27 BCE the establishment of the Principate by Augustus, etc.), and the periods are commonly used in defining key historical periods in historical writing. They are therefore widely recognised and widely used.<br/>

However, while these periods might work from particular perspectives (and essentially Greek and Roman perspectives), they rapidly become of more limited value in regions further removed from Rome or Athens. In the case of Sicily this can perhaps most easily be illustrated by the simple observation that Rome conquered Sicily in the period between 241 and 212 BCE. Should we therefore describe Sicily between 323 and 212 BCE as Hellenistic, but from 212 to 27 BCE as Roman Republican? In one sense this is 'true', at least for the period after 212 BCE, when the island was under Roman rule (but still Greek speaking and in many ways culturally 'Greek'); but in the period before 212 BCE the island was partly under Carthaginian control, so what does 'Hellenistic' mean in this context? In any case, this serves to indicate that historically meaningful periods on the island are likely to differ from those of canonical Greco-Roman historiography. A serious exploration of this would probably start from the bottom up, and seek to define such periods on the basis both of the key historical events on the island and in terms of changes in material culture.

As a preliminary step, we can at least define periods that reflect Sicilian history, such as:<br/>
* Greek Sicily (735 - 212 BCE)
  * Archaic Sicily (735 - 500 BCE)
  * Classical Sicily (500 - 320 BCE)
  * Hellenistic Sicily (320 - 31 BCE)
* Roman Sicily (241 BCE - 535 CE)
  * Republican Sicily (241 - 31 BCE)
  * Imperial Sicily (31 BCE - 284 CE)
  * Later Roman Sicily (284 - 535 CE)
* Byzantine Sicily (535 - 831 CE)

There are clearly aspects of this periodisation that are problematic and many points could be debated.  Some points are reasonably clear, e.g. the starting point (735 BCE) marks the beginning of Greek colonisation; Roman Sicily begins with the ceding of the island to Rome by Carthage in 241; the end of Roman Sicily is distinctly marked by the Byzantine conquest of 535 CE. On the other hand, the transition to Classical and Hellenistic in Sicily is much less clear and so somewhat arbitrary; furthermore, it would be desirable to add a Phoenicio-Punic periodisation also, such as:
* Phoenician Sicily (800 - 480 BCE)
* Punic Sicily (480 - 241 BCE)

The overlap between Hellenistic, Punic and Roman Republican Sicily is deliberate and unavoidable. To some extent this is a deliberate compromise, seeking to align the Sicilian periods with the canonical ones as far as possible. Greater refinement, possibly more radical could be suggested, but this offers a valid starting point.
